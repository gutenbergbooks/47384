<p>We regret that we are unable to offer our Correspondent, upon the
subject of <em class="italic">Gas Works</em>, any precise information. There can be no
doubt that an atmosphere tainted by coal gas is injurious to animal
and vegetable life, but much will depend upon the extent of the
contamination, and other causes, of which our limits prevent mention.
To say nothing of danger from fire and from explosion, it has always
been matter of surprise to us that gas-works are tolerated by the
government in close and confined situations—that the Thames is
suffered still to be polluted with their offal, and that they are
sometimes placed close by the road side, (as at Brentford,) to the
nuisance of every one who passes. These matters want looking into.</p>

<h3 class="hleft" title="On the Beauties contained in the Oval. . .">
 <em class="italic">On the Beauties contained in the Oval, and in the Elliptic Curves,
 both simple and combined, generated from the same Figure or Disk</em>.
 By R. R. Reinagle, Esq., R.A. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a>
 <span class="hr20pct">&#160;</span>
 <span class="hang1 smaller">Being the subject of a Discourse
 delivered at the Royal Institution of Great Britain.</span>
 <span class="hr20pct">&#160;</span></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">A<span>FTER</span></span>
an apposite discourse to introduce the subject, the first
course taken, was to demonstrate the advantages of understanding the
right use of geometrical terms in our descriptions of the varieties
of shape, both in nature and art.</p>

<p>Every thing deserving the title of beautiful, and every grand object,
assume an outline of definite character: these are to be found in the
different classes of geometrical figures; the former in undulating
lines of elliptic curves, and grandeur in angular dispositions of
figure. All motion assumes a curved direction<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-1" href="#fn-1">1</a>. The primary and
leading object of the discourse was to prove the fact of original
beauty: and that a curved line was beautiful in an abstract point
of view, free from all associations. For this purpose there were
designed many diagrams on large black painted boards.
<span class="xxpn" id="p002">[p002]</span></p>

<p>The explanation commenced with six or more parallel lines at equal
distances, and equal length, in an horizontal position to the eye of
the audience, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 1; and another set of the same number of lines
drawn perpendicular, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 2: these were demonstrated to possess not
the slightest character or principle of beauty in them, either as
separate lines, or collectively, however many.</p>

<div class="figc-s2">
<img src="images/i002a.jpg" width="528" height="239" alt="" />
<div class="captable"><div class="tabrow">

<div class="cell50"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 4.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The next diagram consisted of six or more radiating lines from
a centre, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 3, and a corresponding number in an horizontal
direction, but of unequal quantities; they diminished like a flight
of steps, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 4. It was then shown that the first means of
combining the six or more lines, which had been first drawn, so as
to please the eye, without creating any geometrical figure, was the
radiating principle. Our eye not only can tolerate that union of
lines, but receive the impression as pleasing in character; while all
lines parallel to each other, being right <span class="xxpn" id="p003">[p003]</span>
lines, and viewed as a flight of steps, or pile of planks, opposite the observer, are
disagreeable. Upon the former principle it is, that the rays of the
sun, and rays of light generally, are so attractive and beautiful.
It is from this circumstance that right lines drawn in an inclined
position to the plane of the picture, derive an interest from the
angles engendered through the imagination.</p>

<div class="figc-s1">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="600" height="415" alt="" />
<div class="captable"><div class="tabrow">
<div class="cell25"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 5.</div>
<div class="cell25"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 6.</div>
<div class="cell25"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 7.</div>
<div class="cell25"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 8.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>To follow up the principle by regular steps, and to open a clear
view of the laws of beauty in lines, there were traced some inclined
right lines (<em class="italic">Fig.</em> 5), with a regular set of right angles upon it,
like the stems of leaves on each side. This exhibited no sort of
beauty, nor any other advantage than mere combinations of formal
angles. The next diagram (<em class="italic">Fig.</em> 6) was an inclined line as before,
with similar angular projecting stems, to which were added elliptic
curves on the upper side of each branch, that produced the form of a
leaf. <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 7 was another inclined line, having oval curves upon it.
Both these were shown to possess principles approaching to beauty, by
progressive advances in combination and original structure. <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 8
was an inclined line with the oval curves upon it; to which a similar
addition of elliptic curves were adjoined to the stems,
<span class="xxpn" id="p004">[p004]</span>
as in <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 6. This addition made a new advance towards beauty. <em class="italic">Fig.</em>
9 commenced a more perfect principle of beauty, having an elliptic
stem with oval branches rising from it, as in the others. If to this,
the principle of gradation had been given, the eye would prefer it;
I mean, by a scale of increase from the top to the bottom of the
projecting stems: and if there had been superadded the external
contour of a lengthened egg, like the form of a sage leaf, we should,
step by step, advance into the region of beautiful character of
exterior shape. <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 10 is a retrograde, showing how uncongenial
angular forms are to curved lines, when producing ornament; at
least how little our eye can bear the angular projections from the
elliptic or oval turned stem. <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 11 was a curve of exactly the
same disk, with the same oval stems, to which a small serpentine
addition was made, expressing a leaf. Of all the last seven diagrams,
this abounded with the greatest portion of beautiful lines, and is
indisputably the most agreeable and beautiful. Combinations are like
numericals; many of these forms, placed together with judgment and
discretion, will attract us from the larger proportion of beauty
that meets the eye at once, like a head of beautiful hair: one hair,
however gracefully bent, cannot impress us like an entire lock of the
hair; nor will this
<span class="xxpn" id="p005">[p005]</span>
curl charm us as the whole will on the human head. We owe to
construction and combination all our pleasurable feelings of beauty:
no person is allured by a single feature of any species of objects:
but a thousand, or a million, arouses our anxious notice. Thus, the
last diagram of the elliptic stem and the foliage upon it, exhibited,
by the continuity of curved lines, the greatest approach to beauty,
of all the figures presented to the notice of the audience.</p>

<p>These preliminary designs opened the way for richer combinations; but
the subject affording such an immense field of variety, I confined
myself to the narrowest limits, and to one oval disk of seven inches
transverse diameter, from which seven different designs were shown on
paper. The first had a variety of serpentine lines placed at random,
all produced by the disk of the oval just named, and the confluent
lines of two such, placed side by side, or end to end, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 12;
which oval disk was put upon the lines to prove the construction.
These lines, without expressing or forming any sort of figure,
exhibit a set of elegant curves, of varied quantities of convex and
concave, with which our eye will be more pleased than any set of
right lines similarly distributed, as in <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 13, which follows.
<span class="xxpn" id="p006">[p006]</span></p>

<div class="figc-s1">

<div class="caption"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 14.</div>
</div>

<p>Two other diagrams were placed before the company, each a circle of
12 ovals, from the same disk, revolved upon an axis, resting upon one
end of the transverse diameter, (the length-ways of the oval,) which
figure in the skeleton was a duodecagon. <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 14 is one of the
diagrams; the ovals folding regularly over each other. By suppressing
the continuity of the oval disk, where the lines would traverse, a
very pleasing figure
<span class="xxpn" id="p007">[p007]</span>
is created. It may be easily converted
into foliage, and can be amazingly varied in principle, by having
fewer ovals, and making them revolve upon an arm or continuation of
a line from the transverse diameter. <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 15 is the same diagram,
with all the oval lines described, which forms a figure of elegant
intricacy; each member, or curvilinear subdivision, assumes a most
agreeable shape: the whole, at the first sight, does not carry the
evidence of being generated from the same disk. These agreeable
figures may be varied to an extraordinary extent: the two that were
presented were mere examples of some of the numerous changes that any
given oval disk may create.</p>

</div>

<p>The objects next presented, were three vases of very dissimilar
appearance, all produced from the same diagram of the oval; each in
a separate drawing. The first was like a Greek vase with handles;
its character established by employing certain proportions of
quantities, in seven parts. The body has four parts, the foot or
pedestal one; the neck two. The handles were regulated in the
position and projection by lines drawn from the bottom of the vase,
through the ovals which compose the outline of the two sides; and
passing through the transverse diameter. These handles were made
from an oval that was the length of half the line of the transverse
diameter, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 16. The skeleton of angles that
<span class="xxpn" id="p008">[p008]</span>
govern the
shape of this vase, is a very pretty figure of itself. The form does
not proceed from any caprice of irregularity, but is consistent
with rational organization, and symmetrical proportions. The figure
of the plate sufficiently describes the mode of making the diagram
without entering into the detail. <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 17 represents a tazza with
handles: the same disk is apparent, by the dotted lines that made the
first vase. The ovals
<span class="xxpn" id="p009">[p009]</span>
are placed right and left of a central
perpendicular line, dividing the cup in two parts; the transverse
diameters meet in one line parallel to the base of the tazza; a
dotted outline expresses the angular position of the handles: the
concave lip of the tazza is made by the same oval disk, whose
transverse diameter leads to the under line of the folding edge of
the cup. The leg of the tazza is produced by the same small disk
that served for the handles of the first vase. The body of the vase
and the leg form two equal parts; the whole upper extent ought to be
seven parts, so that it is seven and two<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-2" href="#fn-2">2</a>; the width of the base
of the leg measures two parts, and the altitude three, of the seven
parts. These proportions cannot produce any other than agreeable
appearances, apply them as we may.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="figleft isize5">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="252" height="524" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em class="italic">Fig.</em> 18.</div>
</div>

<p>The third vase, exhibited an Hebe cup, with a handle, which presented
a totally different appearance in form to the two previous ones. It
was proportioned by similar principles: the larger disk made the
body, inclined right and left upon the end of the oval. The neck and
the leg were both made from the smaller oval disk; the dotted lines
to the ovals of the leg sufficiently show the fact. The handle and
concave lip of the cup were made by an application of the same disk.
The altitude contained four parts. The body two parts, the leg one
part, and the neck one other part; the handle rises one-eighth above:
every portion of this figure is created by the two disks previously
named. The foliage rises from below and descends from above,
one-fourth of the whole height of the body
<span class="xxpn" id="p010">[p010]</span>
to the commencement
of the concavity of the neck, where the beading runs round.</p>
</div>

<p>I remarked, that by adhering to regular proportional quantities of 1
and 2, 3 and 5, 2 and 5, 7 and 5, 7 and 2, &#38;c., and using elliptic
disks or curves, very great beauties are derived.</p>

<div class="figc-s3">

<div class="caption"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 20.</div>
</div>

<p>A skeleton of the tazza in angles was drawn on a black painted board,
together with oval disks placed upon those lines, which clearly
demonstrated the whole system of the construction. The explanation
of these various diagrams necessarily involved a circumstantial
description of each created figure, which were thoroughly analysed.
Quantity and variety were particularly dwelt upon, as absolutely
necessary to the production of perfect beauty; equalities being
unfriendly to that symmetry which accords with nature. Some other
diagrams were drawn, to show the inelegant appearance of radiating
lines from the concave or convex half of an oval or an ellipse, <em class="italic">Fig.</em>
19: but by drawing another convex half of an oval, and placing those
lines as tangents, greater beauty was formed by the alternate changes
and varieties of inclination of each tangent, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 20. This was
capable of an immediate adaptation to elegant vegetation;
<span class="xxpn" id="p011">[p011]</span>
a few convex and concave elliptic curves added to each tangent,
produced an ear of barley, or an ear of rye, the elegant construction
of which, is rarely noticed in our remarks on nature, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 21.</p>

<div class="figc-s3">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" width="456" height="204" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 21.</div>
</div>

<p>The discussion on these various designs being concluded, some
important compositions of three great and renowned painters were
produced, to corroborate what had been advanced in support of the
native beauty of the oval and ellipse. Raphael’s grand composition of
the dispute on the Sacrament is in three grand oval curves.</p>

<p>The Doctors of the Church on the ground plan are ranged in an oval
convex line; and the heavenly Choirs engage two concave oval shapes
of the same proportion, but of unequal quantities. This is also a
proof of a composition of parts, bearing two to one.</p>

<p>The facility of expressing such a composition, by being geometrical,
is extremely easy.</p>

<p>The second illustration was the Aurora, by Guido, of the Aldobrandini
palace. This was pointed out to depend upon an oval curve, and
continued curvilinear details: the striking beauty of this fine
composition is owing to its great and simple elliptic curve, which
includes the whole group; the attendant hours have the principle of
radiating to a centre of the oval: thus harmonizing and uniting forms
congenial both to principle and nature.</p>

<p>The third grand composition was by Rubens, the Coronation ceremony of
Mary de Medicis, one of the grand Luxemburg pictures.</p>

<p>This very fine composition is contained in an oval concave
<span class="xxpn" id="p012">[p012]</span>
curve, and the figures in several points radiate to a centre. Some
of the group pass the great leading line, but only to the degree
and with the licence that a genius can effect, which destroys the
too great, and the too palpable construction of the composition.
The allegorical figures of Fame and Genius hovering over the royal
personage, establish a centre to the oval, which prevents a void that
would have been weak in the composition.</p>

<p>Three designs were next produced from Etruscan vases, to carry
the evidence further, and to show the original source of the
demonstrations of beauty in Grecian art. One was a charioteer driving
a pair of magnificent horses of the highest spirit, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 22. The
composition is elliptic, and serpentine within.</p>

<div class="figc-s1">
<img src="images/i012.jpg" width="600" height="373" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 22.</div>
</div>

<p>The youthful conductor of the steeds is in a crescent or boat-shaped
car, and his form is elegantly bent to meet the action and motion;
his mantle flows behind in curved and serpentine folds, expressing
the wind occasioned by the velocity of action. A more graceful or
beautiful group and composition cannot be imagined.</p>

<p>The next design was a female in an elegant and very gentle serpentine
action of the figure. Every portion of the outlines was elegant,
from the varied succession of convexity and concavity; not a single
angle could be traced throughout the whole
<span class="xxpn" id="p013">[p013]</span>
of this beautiful
creature. She held in her left arm a very handsome oval vase; and in
the other a sort of scarf with ribands, all serpentine in form. By
her side is placed a young man selected from another Etruscan design.</p>

<div class="figc-out">
<img class="imgout"
 src="images/i013.jpg" width="600" height="469" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 23.</div>
</div>

<p>The line of this figure was the outline of an ellipse; it is
perfection in every respect; and the grace was shown to depend upon
gentle curved lines of convex and concave, alternately blended, and
confluent. The motion of ships at sea is described in gentle elliptic
curves; the wings and plumage of birds assume the oval and elliptic
curves; all the fibres of their feathers have that form; some
flattened, others more rounded: the pine-apple and numberless fruits
have all an oval character of outline.</p>

<p>Many take the character of eggs, pointed at one end, and large and
blunt at the other extremity. The leaves of trees
<span class="xxpn" id="p014">[p014]</span>
have the oval shape more than any other; the bend of the branches, and the
whole external form of many trees is oval.</p>

<p>There is no form of created things which may not be found to
correspond in all its dependent shapes to ovals and ellipses of
various disks, even objects which at first sight seem to contradict
the possibility of meeting this system.</p>

<p>The lecture was closed by some extracts and quotations from Lomazzo,
Dryden, Hogarth, Du Fresnoy, and the Abbé du Bos; the tendency
of which was to show that lines had been mentioned, and had been
written upon without any explanation given that could lead to certain
conclusions. That all these authors attributed to supreme genius
alone, and something of the divinely inspired character in artists,
the power to produce those indescribable lines that affect the human
eye so strongly. These lines I described as belonging to the oval and
the ellipsis, and the confluent lines by conjunction and combination;
that these indescribable lines, which from Plato to Dryden had never
been detected or obtained a name; that puzzled all equally alike, are

the elliptic combinations.</p>

<p>I stated that the great Greek artists confined themselves to certain
rules and principles of unerring consequences in the production
of beauty, grace, or grandeur in their figures; that all their
compositions depended upon the same species of rule and order. I
pointed out, that fashion is in all countries the destroyer of
taste, that it unfits the mind for fixed principles; that where it
dominates, <em class="italic">there</em> taste will be always fluttering and never settle,
nor have a sure dominion. The Greeks, having no such vile tormentor
to divert them from a pure course in their progress, arrived at the
summit of perfection in every scientific pursuit, by following sure
principles as their guides, and by never abandoning a path traced by
nature, and matured by the most sublime philosophy.</p>

<h3 class="h3center"><em class="italic">On the Art of forming Diamonds into single Lenses for
Microscopes</em>.—By Mr. A. Pritchard. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a>
<span class="smaller">
[Communicated by Dr.
<span class="smcaps">G<span>ORING</span></span>.]</span></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">O<span>F</span></span> the various improvements in Microscopes originated by Dr. Goring,
that which he conceives to be the most important is the construction
of single magnifiers from adamant. The details relative to this novel
class of instruments, I have been induced to lay before the public.
Single microscopes naturally aplanatic, or at least sufficiently so
for practical purposes, possess an incontestable superiority over
all others, and must be recognised by the scientific as verging
towards the ultimatum of improvement in magnifying glasses. The
advantages obtained by the most improved compound engiscopes over
single microscopes resolve themselves into <em class="italic">the attainment of vision
without aberration with considerable angles of aperture</em>; but against
this must be set the never-to-be-forgotten fact, that they only show
us a <em class="italic">picture of an object instead of nature itself</em>; now a Diamond
Lens shows us our real object without any sensible aberration like
that produced by glass lenses; and we are entitled, I think, to
expect new discoveries in miscrosopic science, even at this late
period, <em class="italic">from very deep single lenses of
adamant</em><a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-3" href="#fn-3">3</a>. I shall not
fatigue my <span class="xxpn" id="p016">[p016]</span>
readers by describing the difficulties which were
encountered in the prosecution of the design of making diamond
lenses. Nature does not seem to permit us to produce any thing of
surpassing excellence without proportional effort, and I shall simply
say, that in its infancy the project of grinding and polishing the
refractory substance of Adamant was far more hopeless than that of
making achromatic glass lenses of 0.2 of an inch focus. I conceive it
just to state that Messrs. Rundell and Bridge, of Ludgate-hill, had,
at the time of the commencement of my labours, many Dutch diamond
cutters at work, and that the foreman, Mr. Levi, with all his men,
assured me, that it was impossible to work diamonds into spherical
curves; the same opinion was also expressed by several others who
were considered of standard authority in such matters.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this discouragement, in the summer of the year 1824,
I was instigated by Dr. Goring (at his expense) to undertake the
task of working a diamond lens: (being then under the tuition of Mr.
C. Varley, who was however at that time absent.) For this purpose,
Dr. G. forwarded to me a brilliant diamond, which, contrary to the
expectation of many, was at length ground into a spherical
<span class="xxpn" id="p017">[p017]</span>
figure, and examined by Mr. Levi, who expressed great astonishment
at it, and added that he was not acquainted with any means by which
that figure could have been effected: unfortunately this stone was
irrecoverably lost. Mr. Varley having returned from the country,
becoming now thoroughly heated with the project, permitted me to
complete another diamond, which had been presented to me by Dr. G.:
this is a plano-convex of about the
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">20</span></span>th</span>
of an inch focus: it was
not thought advisable to polish it more than sufficed to enable us
to see objects through it, because several flaws, before invisible,
made their appearance in the process of polishing. In spite of all
its imperfections, it plainly convinced us of the superiority which
a <em class="italic">perfect diamond lens</em> would possess by its style of performance,
both as a single magnifier and as the object lens of a compound
microscope. After the completion of my articles with Mr. V., being
entirely under my own command, I devoted some time to the formation
of a perfect diamond lens, and have at length succeeded in completing
a double convex of equal radii of about
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">25</span></span>th</span>
of an inch focus,
bearing an aperture of
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">30</span></span>th</span>
of an inch with distinctness on opaque
objects, and its entire diameter on transparent ones; it was finished
at the conclusion of last year. The date of its final completion
has by many been considered a remarkable epoch in the history of
the microscope, being the first perfect one ever <em class="italic">made</em> or thought
of in any part of the world<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-4" href="#fn-4">4</a>. I think it sufficient to say of
this adamantine lens that it gives vision with a trifling chromatic
aberration, but in other respects exceedingly like that of Dr. G.’s
Amician reflector, but without its darkness: for it is quite evident
that its light must be superior to that of any compound microscope
whatever, acting with the same power and the same angle of aperture.
The advantage of seeing an object <em class="italic">without aberration</em> by
<span class="xxpn" id="p018">[p018]</span>
the interposition of but a single magnifier, instead of looking at
a picture of it (however perfect) with an eye-glass, must surely be
duly appreciated by every person endowed with ordinary reason. It
requires little knowledge of optics to be convinced that the simple
unadulterated view of an object must enable us to look farther into
its real texture, than we can see by any artificial arrangement
whatever; it is like seeing an action performed instead of a scenic
representation of it, or being informed of its occurrence by the most
indisputable and accurate testimony.</p>

<p>Previous to grinding a diamond into a spherical figure, it is
absolutely necessary that it should be ground flat, and parallel
on both sides (if not a Laske or plate diamond), so that we may be
enabled to see through it, and try it as opticians try a piece of
flint glass: without this preparatory step, it will be extremely
dangerous to commence the process of grinding, for many diamonds
give a double, or even a species of triple refraction, forming
two or three images of an object; this polarization of the light,
arising from the primitive form of the crystal, of course totally
unfits them for making lenses<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-5" href="#fn-5">5</a>. I need not observe, that it must
be chosen of the finest water, and free from all visible flaws when
examined by a deep magnifier. It was extremely fortunate for diamond
lenses that the first made was free from the defect of double vision,
otherwise diamonds <em class="italic">en masse</em> might at once have been abandoned as
unfit for optical purposes. The cause why some stones give single
vision, and others several peculiar refractions, may also arise
from different degrees of density or hardness occurring in the same
stone. Diamond-cutters are in the habit of designating stones male
and female, sometimes a <em class="italic">he</em> and <em class="italic">she</em> (as they have it) are united
in the same gem,—their <em class="italic">he</em> means merely a hard stone, and their
<em class="italic">she</em> a soft one. When a diamond which will give several refractions
is ground into a spherical figure and partially polished, it is seen
by the microscope to exhibit a
<span class="xxpn" id="p019">[p019]</span>
peculiar appearance of an
aggregation of minute shivery cristallized flaws, sometimes radiated
and sometimes in one direction, which can never be polished out:
I believe I could disstinguish with certainty a bad lens from a
good one by this phenomenon without looking through it<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-6" href="#fn-6">6</a>. Precious
stones, from their crystalized texture, are liable to the same
defects for optical purposes as diamonds.</p>

<p>Having ascertained the goodness of a stone it must next be prepared
for grinding; it will in many cases be advisable to make diamond
lenses plano-convex, both because this figure gives a very low
aberration, and because it saves the trouble of grinding one side
of the stone. It must never be forgotten, that it may be possible
to neutralize the naturally low spherical aberration of a diamond
lens by giving it an improper figure, or by the injudicious position
of its sides in relation to the radiant. When the lens is to be
plano-convex, cause the flat side to be polished as truly plane as
possible, without ribs or scratches; for this purpose the diamond
should be so set as to possess the capability of being turned round,
that the proper direction with respect to the laminæ may be obtained:
when the flat side is completed, let the other side be worked against
another diamond, so as to be brought into a spherical figure by the
abrasion of its surface. When this is accomplished, a concave tool of
cast iron must be formed of the required curve in a lathe, having a
small mandril of about
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span><span class="fdn">10</span></span>ths</span>
of an inch in diameter, and a velocity
of about 60 revolutions per second! The diamond must now be fixed
by a strong hard cement (made of equal parts of the best shell lac
and pumice-stone powder, carefully melted together without burning)
to a short handle, and held by the fingers against the concave tool
while revolving. This tool must be paved by diamond powder, hammered
into it by an hardened steel convex punch: when the lens is uniformly
ground all over, very fine sifted diamond-dust carefully washed in
oil must be applied to another iron concave tool (I may here remark,
that of all the metals which I have used for this purpose soft cast
iron is decidedly to be preferred): this tool must
<span class="xxpn" id="p020">[p020]</span>
be supplied
with the finest washed powder till the lens is completely polished.
During the process of grinding, the stone should be examined by a
magnifying lens, to ascertain whether the figure is truly spherical;
for it sometimes will occur that the edges are ground quicker than
the centre, and hence it will assume the form of a colloid, and thus
be rendered unfit for microscopic purposes.</p>

<p>The spherical aberration of a diamond lens is extremely small, and
when compared with that of a glass lens the difference is rendered
strikingly apparent. This diminution of error in the diamond arises
from the enormous refractive power possessed by this brilliant
substance, and the consequent increase of amplification, with <em class="italic">very
shallow curves</em>. The longitudinal aberration of a plano-convex
diamond lens is only 0.955; while that of a glass one of the same
figure is 1.166; both numbers being enumerated in terms of their
thickness, and their convex surfaces exposed to parallel rays. But
the indistinctness produced by lenses, arises chiefly from every
mathematical point on the surface of an object being spread out into
a small circle; these circles, intermixing with each other, occasion
a confused view of the object. Now this error must necessarily
be in the ratio of the areas of these small circles, which being
respectively as the squares of their diameters, the lateral error
produced by a diamond lens will be 0.912; while that of a glass lens
of like curvature is 2.775; but the magnifying power of the diamond
lens will be to that of the glass as 8 to 3, their curves being
similar; (or, in other words, the superficial amplification of an
object; with the perfect diamond lens before mentioned, is 22500
times, while a similar magnifier, made of glass, amplifies only 3136
times, reckoning 6 inches as the standard of distinct vision:) thus
the diamond will enable us to gain more power than it is possible to
procure by lenses of glass, for the focal distance of the smallest
glass lens which can be well made is about the
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">80</span></span>th</span>
of an inch,
while that of a diamond, worked in the same tools, would be only the
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">200</span></span></span> of an inch.</p>

<p>If we wish to compare the aberrations of the two lenses when of equal
power, the curvature of the glass must be increased; and as it is
well known the lateral aberration increases inversely as the square
of the radius, (the aperture and position remaining
<span class="xxpn" id="p021">[p021]</span>
the same,)
the aberration of the diamond lens will only be about
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">20</span></span>th</span> of that
produced by the glass one, even when their thickness is the same; but
as the curvature of the diamond is less, the thickness may be greatly
diminished.</p>

<p>The chromatic dispersion of the adamant being nearly as low as that
of water, its effects in small lenses can barely be appreciated by
the eye, even in the examination of that valuable class of test
objects, which require enormous angles of aperture to be rendered
visible, which it is evident must be of easier attainment by diamond
magnifiers than by any other sort of microscope.</p>

<p>A mathematical investigation of the spherical aberration of the
diamond when formed into lenses, I hope to lay before the public at
a future opportunity. The comparative numbers here taken from the
longitudinal aberration are, I believe, sufficiently accurate for
practical purposes.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn-3" href="#fnanchor-3">3</a> It seems generally admitted that, within a certain range of
power not exceeding that of a lens of
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">20</span></span>th</span>
of an inch focus,
the beauty and truth of the vision given by the new compound
microscopes cannot be equalled by that of any single instrument,
at least of glass. It is no less true, however, that the <em class="italic">picture</em>
of the compounds, however perfect, is not like a real object, will
not admit of amplification beyond a certain point with advantage.
Under the action of very deep eye-glasses, the image of opaque
objects especially, first loses its strong, well-determined
outline—then grows soft and nebulous, and finally melts away in
shadowy confusion. Let the experiment be made of raising the power
of a compound up to that of a
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">60</span></span></span>
inch lens—then try it against
the single microscope of that power (having, of course, the utmost
opening the nature of the object viewed will permit). The observer,
if open to conviction, will soon be taught the superior efficacy
of the latter—for it will show the lines on the dust of Menelaus
with such force and vivacity, that they will always be apparent
<em class="italic">without any particular management of the light—nor can their image
be extinguished by causing the illumination to be directed truly
through the axis of the lens (as it always may in the compounds)</em>.
A due consideration of the teeth and inequalities on the surface
of a human hair, together with the <em class="italic">transverse connecting fibres
between the lines on the scales of the curculio imperialis</em>, viewed
as opaque objects, will suffice to complete the illustration of
the subject; though the last object is not to be well seen by that
kind of light which is given by silver cups—and a single lens of
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">60</span></span></span>
inch focus can of course have no other. The effectiveness and
penetrating faculties of simple magnifiers are invariably increased
by an accession of power however great—that of compounds seems to
be deteriorated beyond certain limits. An opinion may be hazarded
that the achromatics and reflectors yet made <em class="italic">do not really surpass
the efficacy of equivalent single lenses, even of glass, when
their power exceeds that of a</em>
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">20</span></span></span> lens, from
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">20</span></span></span> to
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">40</span></span></span>
the vision may be about equal—but from
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">40</span></span></span> upwards infinitely
inferior.</p>

<p>The superior light of the single refraction can need no comment—and
it is evident that there must be a degree of power at which that
of the compounds will become too dim and feeble for vision,—while
that of the single instrument will still retain a due intensity.
For these reasons it is conceived that the close and penetrating
scrutiny of lenses of diamond of perhaps only the
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">200</span></span></span> inch
focus, and an equal aperture (which their very low aberration would
easily admit of,) must enable us to see further into the arcana of
nature than we have yet been empowered to do. Glass globules of
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">200</span></span></span>
inch focus and indeed much deeper have been executed; but
the testimony of <em class="italic">lenses</em> of diamond would certainly be far more
respectable, and is at least worthy of trial and examination.—C.R.G.</p>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn-4" href="#fnanchor-4">4</a> In Dr. Brewster’s treatise on new Philosophical instruments,
Book 5, chap. 2, Page 403—Account of a new compound Microscope for
objects of Natural History—is the following passage: “We cannot
therefore expect any essential improvement in the single microscope,
unless from the discovery of some transparent substance, which like
the diamond combines a high refractive with a low dispersive power.”
From which it seems certain that the Doctor never contemplated the
possibility of working upon the substance of the diamond, though he
must have been aware of its valuable properties.</p>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn-5" href="#fnanchor-5">5</a> There are fourteen different crystalline forms of the diamond,
and of this number, from the laws which govern the polarization of
light, the octohedron and truncated cube are probably the only ones
that will give single vision. It is unfortunately very difficult
to procure rough diamonds in this country, so we are compelled to
use stones already cut, and to subject them to trial in the way
mentioned in the text.</p>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn-6" href="#fnanchor-6">6</a> As many amateurs of science might take an interest in the

<h3 class="h3center"><em class="italic">Analysis of a newly-discovered Spring, at Stanley, near
Wakefield</em>.—By Mr. William West. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">M<span>INERAL</span></span> springs,
dependent for their characteristic properties on
carbonate of soda, appear to have been little noticed by chemists,
and to have been still less attended to as curative means; at least
in proportion to the multitude of cases in which that substance is
administered in various other forms. Indeed the inference to be
drawn from the silence respecting the modes of analysis adapted to
such waters in our best elementary treatises, is that they have
hitherto been very seldom met with. In one district, however, of
Yorkshire, carbonate of soda is of frequent occurrence; it is found
in the ordinary springs; often, at the same time with substances
with which, in artificial solutions, or when concentrated, it, would
be considered wholly incompatible; while at other times it is the
predominant, or the only remarkable saline constituent. An analysis
of a water of this kind, known by the name of the Holbeck Spa, has
lately been published in the Annals of Philosophy, by my friend E.
S. George; similar springs are found, I understand, as far
<span class="xxpn" id="p022">[p022]</span>
westward as Bradford; they are numerous from the borings in and near
Holbeck; while eight miles south, a water similar in its character,
but differing in containing about twice as much alkali in the same
measure, has been discovered at Stanley.</p>

<p>About two miles from Wakefield, near the Aberford or York road, is
an ancient mansion called Hatfield Hall; near the park or inclosure
of which, in boring for coal, the spring in question suddenly gushed
up, when the workmen had got to the depth of eighty yards, and has
continued to run spontaneously, in all seasons, at the rate of six
gallons per minute.</p>

<p>The water at the spring is limpid and very sparkling; the portion
which is allowed to escape, deposits upon the trough and in the
channel through which it runs a quantity of sulphur; the smell is
that of sulphuretted hydrogen; the taste, from the stimulus of the
bubbles of gas modifying the softness of the alkali, rather pleasant
than otherwise.</p>

<p>The appearances presented by re-agents
<span class="nowrap">are,—</span></p>

<p>With tincture of soap, a slight opalescence.</p>

<p>Nitrate of silver, an abundant precipitate, partially re-dissolved by
pure nitric acid.</p>

<p>Sulphate of silver, a precipitate only partially soluble in nitric or
acetic acid.</p>

<p>Muriate of barytes, a slight precipitate.</p>

<p>Lime-water, a precipitate soluble with effervescence in acetic acid.</p>

<p>Oxalate of ammonia, no precipitate.</p>

<p>On boiling, a slight pellicle appeared, soluble in nitric acid.</p>

<p>Carbonate of ammonia, no precipitate, nor any on the subsequent
addition of phosphate of soda.</p>

<p>The water restored the colour of litmus paper slightly reddened.</p>

<p>With tincture of galls and ferrocyanate of potash, no change.</p>

<p>With muriate of lime, the water remained unchanged until heated; but
when boiled, a copious precipitate took place.</p>

<p>When concentrated by boiling, the water reddened turmeric paper, and
effervesced strongly on the addition of an acid.</p>

<p>Nitromuriate of platina produced no precipitate, however concentrated
the water might be.
<span class="xxpn" id="p023">[p023]</span></p>

<p>The results of the previous experiments indicate the presence of</p>

<ul class="liinline45">
<li>Soda,</li>
<li>Lime in small proportion,</li>
<li>Muriatic acid,</li>
<li>No magnesia,</li>
<li>Sulphuric acid, </li>
<li>No iron,</li>
<li>Carbonic acid,</li>
<li>No potash.</li>
</ul>

<p>A. To ascertain the proportion of sulphuric acid, sixteen ounces
by measure, previously saturated by acetic acid, were treated with
muriate of barytes; the precipitate, washed and dried, weighed
one grain; this indicates, in the imperial gallon, 3.2 grains of
sulphuric acid, equivalent to 5.8 sulphate of soda, dry, or 13 grains
crystallized.</p>

<p>B. For the muriatic acid; nitrate of silver, added to sixteen ounces
of the water boiled, and the alkali previously saturated, gave a
precipitate weighing 2.8 grains; reduced to the proportion in the
imperial gallon, this amounts to 26.9 grains chloride of silver,
equivalent to 11 grains chloride of sodium (muriate of soda.)</p>

<p>C. The crystalline pellicle separated from a pint of sixteen ounces,
on boiling, weighed 0.2 grains.</p>

<p>This was carbonate of lime; but in the water the lime would be
combined with muriatic acid, forming 0.22; or, in the imperial
gallon, 2.1 dry chloride, or 3.75 crystallized muriate of lime.</p>

<p>D. The precipitate formed on boiling with muriate of lime, weighed
from the pint, 3.6 grains; from the imperial gallon, 34.6 grains;
showing the water to contain in that quantity a carbonated alkali
equivalent to 53 grains of dry, or 59.5 crystallized bi-carbonate of
soda.</p>

<p>E. Muriate of barytes, added to the water left on evaporating sixteen
ounces to two, gave a precipitate weighing 8.2 grains; deducting one
grain for sulphate of barytes, as found in experiment A, we have 7.2
carbonate of barytes; this indicates in the gallon 53 grains of dry,
and 59.5 of crystallized carbonate of soda, as in the last experiment.</p>

<p>Lastly, a pint of sixteen ounces of the water, evaporated to dryness,
furnished in three trials of saline residuum, weighed after short
exposure to a dull red heat, six grains, or 57.6 from
<span class="xxpn" id="p024">[p024]</span> the
imperial gallon. Now we have seen that this would consist of</p>

<p>The remainder, 38.9, having been converted by the heat into
proto-carbonate of soda, is equivalent to 54.5 dry, 61 grains
crystallized bi-carbonate, agreeing nearly with the quantities found
from experiments D and E.</p>

<p>Following, as I do, that doctrine which supposes the bases to be
distributed among the acids in a mineral water in the combinations
which possess the greatest solubility, we must suppose the lime to be
in the state of muriate; we shall then have to diminish the muriate,
and increase the carbonate of soda: so that on this view, the saline

<p>The gaseous contents of the water consist of variable proportions
of carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, and carburetted hydrogen;
the latter gas is continually emitted from the spring, in greater
quantity than the water can absorb; and a portion of the other two
also escapes from its surface. I have made many experiments on
the gas, separated by boiling; but find the results, as I might
anticipate, altogether inconclusive and uncertain. In waters
containing, as at Harrogate, these gases with muriates or sulphates,
boiling may be expected almost wholly to disengage them; but in this
case the affinity of the soda in dilute solution, is likely to retain
the carbonic
<span class="xxpn" id="p025">[p025]</span>
acid, and even to cause a decomposition of the
sulphuretted hydrogen, so as to prevent our obtaining, in a gaseous
form, the quantity really existing in the water, and imparting to it
sensible or medicinal properties.</p>

<p>On the subject of medicinal qualities I am at all times cautious of
giving an opinion: but I may observe, first, that as this spring is
dissimilar to any of those which have already attained celebrity, so
none of them can form a substitute for this; it is not Harrogate,
or Cheltenham, or Buxton, or Tunbridge water: the alkaline springs
of the West Riding, of which this is by far the strongest, stand
as medicinal waters hitherto alone; the active ingredient, the
bi-carbonate of soda, being spoken of in chemical works, as “rarely
found in mineral waters.”</p>

<p>Secondly, from the known properties of this substance, carbonate
of soda, and the frequency of its administration in a long train
of arthritic, calculous and dyspeptic complaints, the water must
be highly useful as an anti-acid and as a diuretic; and as the
advantages which native mineral waters possess over artificial
solutions of the substances, in the great degree of dilution, and
the impregnation with gases, and still more in the adjuncts of
leisure, exercise, pure air, regulated diet and early rising, are of
especial consequence in the latter very numerous class of diseases,
those called stomach and nervous complaints; we may fairly suppose
that such a spring will be found to be a valuable addition to those
previously known, applying, as it does, to cases of such frequent
occurrence.</p>

<em class="italic">Observations on the State of Naval
Construction in this Country</em>. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">I<span>T</span></span>
appears that there is at present a tendency to improvement in
every branch of science; monopoly in intellect may now be said
to be vanishing; and empiricism is obliged to seek dark corners,
to escape the light which is penetrating into regions from which
it had but very lately been excluded. The administration, too,
encourages advance of knowledge; yet notwithstanding these favourable
circumstances, there still exists, in
<span class="xxpn" id="p026">[p026]</span>
some minds, an
inaptitude of scientific perception, which induces unwillingness to
acknowledge the advantage that results from the application of the
exact sciences to the useful arts.</p>

<p>This neglect of scientific principles is nowhere more manifest than
in the affairs of naval architecture, and it is not confined to the
Royal Navy, but extends also to our mercantile shipping; and hence
it is that our commercial marine is in some respects behind foreign
nations, especially the Americans, in the formation of its ships:
our merchantmen are, almost without exception, the most unsafe<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-7" href="#fn-7">7</a>
and slowest ships in the world. The ship-owners, therefore, would do
well to consider this circumstance, and endeavour to devise means of
introducing science into the merchant yards. The establishment of the
new university in the metropolis affords an opportunity of doing it
at a comparatively small expense, by the foundation of Lectures on
the theory of Naval Architecture; and the support even of a separate
institution in the vicinity of the merchant yards of this great port,
for the education of ship surveyors, would soon be repaid by the
improved character of our merchant shipping.</p>

<p>If the science of Naval Architecture depend on certain
physico-mathematical laws, as no doubt it does, it is monstrous to
imagine for a moment that such laws can be developed by a flight of
fancy, or that a man is born with an <em class="italic">intuitive optical</em> perception
of the lines of least resistance, &#38;c., or, in the jargon of the
craniologists, that he has a naval-architectural bump on his skull;
yet one would think that such was the case, when we see men, we
cannot say philosophers, start up and loudly assert that they are
in possession of the secret of construction; and they are believed
because their hypotheses are never submitted to the examination of
those who are capable of detecting their fallacy.</p>

<p>The Experimental Squadrons have, with a multitude of perplexing
results, elicited, it must be confessed, at least an interesting
fact, viz. that there has been an establishment seventeen years in
this country, in Portsmouth dockyard, for the scientific education
of naval architects, for the Royal
<span class="xxpn" id="p027">[p027]</span>
Navy.<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-8" href="#fn-8">8</a> From the plan of
education, as laid down by the Commissioners of Naval Revision in
1810, it appears that, to a requisite knowledge of the <em class="italic">practice</em>
of their profession, the gentlemen composing this body of naval
constructors unite a sound and competent one of its <em class="italic">theory</em><a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-9" href="#fn-9">9</a>.</p>

<p>It can only be from such a source that we can look for the
improvement of our men of war, and it is to be regretted that every
means should not be taken to avail ourselves of it: but unhappily
such is the force of prejudice that, unless some alteration should be
adopted in this institution, it will be in vain to expect advantage
from it.</p>

<p>The objection urged against this establishment, namely, that the
scientific education it gives to its members precludes them from the
attainment of a due knowledge of the practical construction of our
ships, is so absurd, that none but weak or jealous minds could ever
have brought it forward. Shall it be laid down, in the present age,
as an axiom, that a profound ignorance of the principles of his art
is the one thing essential to the formation of what is generally
meant by the term “practical man?” We contend that, having made,
<em class="italic">in vain</em>,<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-10" href="#fn-10">10</a> a long and most indulgent trial of a system without
science, if we may use such an expression, we must extend to one
in alliance with it, a like patronage, before we can be allowed to
pronounce a fair and legitimate judgment upon its efficiency.</p>

<p>But even in the peculiar path in which the naval architects educated
at Portsmouth might be supposed to excel, we do not find that any
opportunity is allowed them to come forward, nor shall we see this
until some effort is made by the heads of our naval departments, to
allow a broad and open competition to take place. It may be urged,
that the learned Professor at Portsmouth (Dr. Inman) in himself
includes all that can have
<span class="xxpn" id="p028">[p028]</span>
possibly been taught or understood
in the establishment over which he presides, and that therefore he
is the representative of it in the late and present trials for the
palm of excellence; but we cannot by any means assent to this: many
of the students must have left his tuition seven, eight, and nine
years, and must be between thirty and forty years of age; and it
would be strange indeed, if during such a period, and in the prime
of life and intellect, some of these, if not all, had not cultivated
the science after their own bent of mind, and formed original ideas
on the subject: we say, therefore, that Dr. Inman’s constructions
cannot be called the production of the establishment—they are merely
the effort of one man, whose attention it appears is distracted by a
multiplicity of occupations, and can only, along with the vessels of
Capts. Symonds, Hayes, and Sir R. Seppings, be deemed criterions of
the particular views of an individual.</p>

<p>Mysticism and ignorance always accompany each other; and we may
reckon that in proportion as the latter disappears from amongst our
ship-builders, so will the absurd vagaries of the former recede, and
the subject be placed at last on the true principles of philosophical
induction, instead of the caprices of imagination. We look forward,
therefore, to this new body of naval architects for the expulsion of
all quackery from their profession, and for the exposition not only
of what we really do know, but also of what we do not know about it:
this is the only way to arrive at truth, which should be the sole
object of all investigation; but which we are afraid has hitherto
been sadly garbled and perverted wherever it has had to do with naval
architecture in this country.</p>

<p>But we repeat that we do not see that the nation is at all likely to
benefit from the science or exertions of those gentlemen so long as
they are placed in situations where a superior education can have no
other effect than producing disgust and chagrin in the mind of the
possessor; and if the institution at Portsmouth be designed for no
better purpose than that of supplying house-carpenters, joiners, and
still more inferior trades, with foremen, it had better be abolished.
Some would regard it, as at present used, as a gross mockery on the
public
<span class="xxpn" id="p029">[p029]</span>
at whose expense it is supported; it is certainly a
cruel one of those who have been induced, by the fair and brilliant
prospects held out to them of support and encouragement, to devote
their lives to this branch of the public service.</p>

<p>But to return to the Experimental Squadron: it is with regret that
we must conclude, upon a careful consideration, that, although the
experiments are carried on with so much vigour and interest, they are
evidently founded on imaginative views, and that there cannot exist
any thing like legitimate data where so many failures and anomalous
results obtain. Who can read the account of the first Experimental
Squadron<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-11" href="#fn-11">11</a>, without immediately perceiving that the constructors
of the contending vessels, however sanguine each might have been of
the success of his particular fancy, met with nothing but the most
perplexing results? We see sometimes one and sometimes the other
vessel claim the palm of excellence, and finally leaving the subject
as much in the dark as ever. This is the natural consequence of the
non-application of inductive philosophy to the question before us,
and the most important conclusion that can be gathered from the
experiment is, that we have begun at the wrong end, and that it is
high time to employ analysis instead of synthesis to effect the
desired objects: for in the present state of the theory of naval
construction in this country, there are yet no data existing to
effect with precision and confidence the synthetical composition of a
ship.</p>

<p>We cannot refrain here from noticing the paucity of information
contained in the reports hitherto made on the first Experimental
Squadron. The best one<a class="fnanchor" href="#fn-11">11</a> is but little removed from a ship’s
log book, and in some respects is inferior to it: it is of such
a scanty nature, that we can scarcely inform ourselves on any
point, and that only in a <em class="italic">relative</em> degree, of the qualities of
the vessels composing it: we cannot find out any mention of their
<em class="italic">absolute</em> velocities on the different points of sailing, which is
a most important omission. We are neither informed in what way the
observations were conducted, whether they were made simultaneously
or not: unless the former, any attempt at comparison must be very
doubtful, if not entirely fallacious. Circumstances of wind and
the weather may very widely alter in the
<span class="xxpn" id="p030">[p030]</span>
course of a short
time, and every endeavour at legitimate analogy be destroyed by such
variation. We strongly suspect that this is one cause of perplexity;
and another prolific one is the vague idea given of the strength of
winds by nautical language. Nothing but the determinations of the
anemometer should ever be allowed to appear in an account of such
experiments. Every circumstance attendant on the quantity and trim of
sail, the heeling, the rolling and pitching of the ship, position of
the rudder, &#38;c. should be accurately ascertained and <em class="italic">tabulated</em>; for
it is next to an impossibility and a wilful waste of time to attempt
to institute comparisons without pursuing a system of tabulated
results, which should be kept in the same form on board each ship.</p>

<p>We must also express our regret that the scientific professor at
Portsmouth does not appear to have ascertained the position of the
centre of gravity of any of his ships, with regard to height, by the
simple and easy experiment long known in principle, and described
lately with geometrical rigidity in two or three publications by
some of his pupils<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-12" href="#fn-12">12</a>. The knowledge of the position of this point
would have placed him so far above his competitors, in so many
important particulars, that we are surprised he should have thrown
away his advantage, and descended to a level with his less scientific
opponents. We are afraid that, here again, imaginative views have
stepped in, and taken the sober mathematician from the only path by
which excellence can be attained. We are at a loss to conceive how
the stabilities of his ships can be said to be ascertained without
the knowledge of the position of this point.</p>

<p>Some of the obscurity which pervades this difficult subject may be
overcome, as to broad and general principles, by attentively and
<em class="italic">coolly</em> observing the progress of marine architecture, since the
introduction of cannon into naval warfare, and more particularly
during the last century and a half. We shall then clearly perceive
that the French, who, as early as the beginning of the reign of Louis
<span class="allcaps">XIV</span>.,
employed men of first-rate talent in their naval arsenals,
and neglected no opportunity for the
<span class="xxpn" id="p031">[p031]</span>
advancement of science
in them, increased and kept increasing the dimensions of their
ships, more especially the length, the ratio of which to the breadth
has been augmented by them from about
<span class="mixfract">3<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span></span>.1,
to 4.1 within the
last century. While this principle was acted on, the improvement
of their ships was gradual; and by referring to our own progress
in the art, in tardy imitation of the practice of the French, we
shall likewise conclude that our navy has derived precisely similar
advantages from the same causes. Here we have at once two grand but
<em class="italic">concurring</em> results derived from an experiment, not made on one or
half a dozen different vessels, but on the whole navies of the two
most powerful maritime states in the world: and if to these we choose
to add the result of the practice of the same means on the Spanish
and other navies, we might surely be warranted in saying, from this
broad but <em class="italic">certain analysis</em> of <em class="italic">facts</em>, that, in relation to the
hull, the <em class="italic">general increase of dimensions, with a greater relative
length</em>, is one cause of the improvements that have been made in the
sea-going qualities of the ships composing the fleets of the present
maritime powers: the question therefore that remains to be decided
on in relation to this principle is, whether we have arrived at its
utmost practicable limits, or rather, whether we have arrived at the
<em class="italic">maximum</em> of improvement it is capable of producing.</p>

<p>This brings us again to the experimental squadrons, as far as they
are connected with, and illustrative of, our observations; and the
first question naturally put forward about them is, whether there be
any thing very peculiar in the formation or dimensions of the rival
vessels? We suspect that the answer cannot otherwise than disclose,
that neither in principle, dimensions, nor in the formation, can they
be said to differ very materially from each other, or from ships of
the common construction: indeed we perceive in some a retrogression
of ideas and a violation of the principle, that the increase of the
ratio of the length to the breadth, in conjunction with a general
increase of dimensions, has been a predominant cause of improvement.
The fact also of so immaterial a difference necessarily includes a
system of masting and sails equally confined, and totally inadequate
to produce any great superiority of sailing over ships to which they
are so nearly equal in principal dimensions.
<span class="xxpn" id="p032">[p032]</span></p>

<p>After so many years of trial with the present nearly invariable set
of principal dimensions, during which period it may be said, that
every possible contour of hull has been experimented on with them,
we are inclined to think that almost all has been done that could
be done under such restrictions, and that some great step must be
made in one or other of the principal dimensions themselves, with
correspondent alterations in the masting, before we can expect to
see a decided and great improvement in the sailing of our ships.
The depth is an element which has arrived at its limit from very
apparent external causes; but the length and breadth remain to the
skilful constructor without any such clogs to his endeavours; and
he has only to accommodate their relation to each other in the
manner most conducive to velocity, which in our opinion is the very
capital object of naval construction, both in ships of war and of
commerce. That it is so in the former, no one will, we apprehend, on
due reflection deny; but there will be many who will assert that it
cannot be obtained, in the latter, without a sacrifice of capacity;
which will defeat the object of carrying large cargoes: to this
we may reply, that if a vessel with an expense of one quarter the
capacity can make <em class="italic">three</em> voyages instead of <em class="italic">two</em>, will not the
merchant be still a considerable gainer in capacity, and still more
so by a ready return of his capital<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-13" href="#fn-13">13</a>?</p>

<p>All observations on well-conducted experiments concur in proving that
velocity is gained by increasing the length, to a much greater degree
in relation to the breadth, than has ever yet been done in ships; and
that the increase of the same element contributes to their weathering
powers is too obvious to need insisting upon: it is also generally
advantageous, when not carried to an extent which would seriously
retard the manœuvring of the ship. This limit has not yet by any
means been determined; for it must be recollected, that although
the additional length increases the resistance to rotation about a
vertical axis, yet the power of the sails to give rotation about the
same is also increased, although not in so high a ratio. The power of
the rudder to produce rotation is also greater in a long ship than
in
<span class="xxpn" id="p033">[p033]</span>
a short one, not only on account of the greater distance
it is from the axis of rotation, but also on account of the greater
velocity, and the more direct impulse of the water on it.</p>

<p>The increase of the ratio of the length to the breadth to produce
velocity should not interfere with the increase of breadth necessary
to produce stability or capacity; for both these qualities, varying
as higher powers of the breadth, a very small increase of breadth may
be attended with a considerable increase of length. If we compare
the Caledonia’s (120 guns) dimensions with those of the Royal George
and Queen Charlotte<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-14" href="#fn-14">14</a>, of 1788 and 1789, we shall find, that 13
or 14 times as much length as breadth has been added to the first
rates of our navy. If we refer to the dimensions of the Commerce
de Marseilles, and those of the next preceding three-decker of the
French navy (for instance, the Ville de Paris<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-15" href="#fn-15">15</a>, taken in Lord
Rodney’s action), we shall find that the French naval architects gave
in her 21 times as much increase to the length as to the breadth. If
this could be done with safety in a three-decked ship, with such a
vast top weight, much more could it be carried advantageously into
effect in ships of two decks, and frigates; but we do not find, in
the latter classes of the ships of the French navy, the increase of
length to go beyond six times that of the breadth. If we refer to the
Old Bellerophon, built in 1772, and the New Bellerophon, built in
1819, we shall find an increase of 24 feet in length, to 1.58 feet
increase of breadth; or the former more than 15 times the latter<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-16" href="#fn-16">16</a>.</p>

<p>To those who oppose the objection that a greater length than at
present used would make the manœuvring of a ship too slow, we
answer, that as the Caledonia and the present first rates of our
navy, although from 10 to 15 feet longer than our two-deckers, are
found to be capital ships in this respect, there is a sure ground
to believe, that the addition of 20 feet in length to the present
two-deckers would not render their celerity
<span class="xxpn" id="p034">[p034]</span>
of evolution
less than that of the three-decker; and since, from the reduction
of weight aloft, the centre of gravity would be lowered, and the
displacement required to be less, a somewhat smaller breadth might
be allowed to a two-decked ship of 206 feet long, than to one of 196
feet (especially since the quantity of sail, remaining the same, is
lowered by one whole depth between deck), a smaller midship section
would be, <em class="italic">cæteris paribus</em>, required; the velocity of this ship
might be considerably increased. Nothing however can be precisely
determined on, with such a complication of circumstances, beyond a
general idea. Calculation and a strict analysis of ships must be
resorted to, in order to fill up the outline of our reasoning.</p>

<p>But for the same reason that we imagine that an addition of 20
or perhaps 40 feet would not sensibly injure the celerity of
manœuvring of our two-deckers, we should think that the same
increase of this dimension might be tried without much risk to our
first rates, with an increase of breadth not exceeding
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">20</span></span></span> part
that is given to the length.</p>

<p>We repeat that the very capital object of the science of Naval
Construction is <em class="italic">velocity</em>, and we are decidedly of opinion that
it is attainable in a much higher degree than at present, without
compromising other necessary qualities, for which we have the
concurrence of facts as far as they go.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Americans, in the last war, took every possible advantage
suggested by views similar to those we have been adverting to, in
the construction of their large frigates. They had, it may be said,
to create a martial navy, and they had to oppose it against fearful
odds; but, free from the prejudices and errors so blindly cherished
by their opponents, and which constantly oppose reform by always
declaring the present practice to be the best, they did not retread
the old path, but began at its last step, and boldly advanced on
this principle into all the branches of the art. They built vessels
upon the most enlarged dimensions, and of a superior weight of
metal, and gave an increased ratio of length to the breadth. The
result of such a procedure, justified the confidence of the American
naval architects in only <em class="italic">one</em> maxim, founded upon the <em class="italic">scientific</em>
observation of facts, and may give us a faint idea of what might
be effected by a still more enlarged and mathematical analysis.
<span class="xxpn" id="p035">[p035]</span>
Our frigates were so inferior to theirs in every way, that
they brought nothing but disasters upon us, excepting in the action
between the Shannon and Chesapeake, and one or two others, where,
assured by their previous successes, our gallant opponents threw away
the advantages possessed by their ships, by coming to close quarters
at once, and deciding the contest hand to hand.—Our ships of the
line could never bring these frigates to action, and owing alone to
their extraordinary sailing, did they evade and mock a large British
fleet. We were finally obliged to build 60-gun frigates after their
method, but when it was <em class="italic">too late</em> for the exigency of the period;
and thus it has ever been our fate, for want of science in the
constructors of our navy, to follow the steps of our enemies at a
humble distance, and to be only then driven out of the old track by a
terrible experience of its inefficiency.</p>

<p>Nor have the Americans stopped here;—Mr. Huskisson plainly tells us
that “America is, year after year, augmenting its military marine, by
building ships of war of the largest class<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-17" href="#fn-17">17</a>.” According to Capt.
Brenton, they have built a first-rate<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-18" href="#fn-18">18</a> of 245 feet length on the
gun deck, and 56 feet broad<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-19" href="#fn-19">19</a>, to carry 42-pounders on the lower
deck, and 32-pounders on the other decks.</p>

<p>Our small class of 74-gun ships lately converted into frigates
carrying <em class="italic">fifty</em> 32-pounder guns, we are fearful can only produce
disappointment if ever brought against the American frigates (not by
conversion, but by <em class="italic">construction</em>), which carry <em class="italic">sixty-two</em> guns of
the same calibre, and are 180 feet long on the gun deck.</p>

<p>We must not forget also that our active neighbours the French have
now adopted a most formidable description of
<span class="xxpn" id="p036">[p036]</span>
frigates, with
curvilinear sterns<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-20" href="#fn-20">20</a>, and many other important improvements. They
mount 60 guns and carronades—viz. 24-pounders on the gun deck, and
36-pounder carronades on the flush deck.—The former calibre is
equivalent very nearly to 26, and the latter to 39 lbs. avoirdupois.</p>

<p>When we reflect on these circumstances, we cannot but feel surprised
that so many frigates of inferior force and dimensions should be
building in our dockyards. In time of emergency they will only bring
on us a repetition of former disasters and deficiency. We contend
that, instead of building ships of only <em class="italic">equal</em> force to those of our
rivals, and thus <em class="italic">waiting</em> for the developement of <em class="italic">their</em> designs
before we can venture on a single step, we should build beyond them
in every respect. It must and ought to be recollected, that peace in
these matters produces a contest of intellect, and those will have
the advantage in it who attack instead of standing on the defensive.
We ought to lead the way, and to be at the head of the maritime
world, not in <em class="italic">number</em> alone, but also in the <em class="italic">individual force and
qualities</em> of our ships.</p>

<p>Having expatiated on the advantages of an increased ratio of length
to breadth in relation to the hull of a ship, we will just glance
at some of the principal effects it would have upon the masting
and sails; and here again we conceive that Professor Inman has, in
common with many others, relinquished the many good effects resulting
from it, for the inadequate one, of being able to carry a somewhat
greater quantity of sail, which must necessarily be lofty, and which,
(setting aside this detracting circumstance,) as the velocity of a
ship varies only as a <em class="italic">fractional</em> power of the surface of canvas
spread, cannot produce the degree of fast sailing to be wished for,
but at an immense and impracticable quantity of sail<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-21" href="#fn-21">21</a>.</p>

<p>A greater proof of the inadequacy of the present system of
<span class="xxpn" id="p037">[p037]</span>
lofty sail cannot be cited than the fact of its not procuring, under
the most favourable circumstances, a rate of sailing rarely exceeding
one-fourth the velocity of the wind.</p>

<p>As the number of masts should be so regulated as to create facility
in managing the canvas, which is well known to be at present hardly
manageable in a gale of wind, on board large ships, from the enormous
size of each individual course and topsail, we should not hesitate,
therefore, to have <em class="italic">four</em> vertical masts, as recommended by Bouguer,
instead of three, in ships built in accordance with the principles
we have been discussing. This would, <em class="italic">cæteris paribus</em>, require
shorter masting and smaller yards, and the sails being much less,
individually, would be more easily managed and not so liable to
accidents.</p>

<p>From what has been said, and the actual experiments now pending, it
is apparent that the theoretic construction of ships is at a very
low ebb in this country; yet a fine opportunity now presents itself,
if we choose to avail ourselves of it, for rescuing the nation from
this generally acknowledged odium. Let a proper use be made of the
corps of Naval Architects we have, somehow or other, at last got, and
let their exertions, under a degree of encouragement equal to that
bestowed on the old ship-builders <em class="italic">in vain</em> for so long a period, be
directed towards the improvement of their art. If they fail, they
cannot claim the excuse of having their endeavours repressed; if they
succeed, as no doubt they will, in advancing their profession to
something beyond mere carpentry, we shall be enabled to bid adieu to
the old and <em class="italic">ruinous</em> method of blundering, under the reign of which
nothing but disappointment can ever be reasonably expected.</p>

<p>We have seen and do still see the immense advantages derived by our
country from the encouragement of those branches of science connected
with its manufactures and agriculture; and if we wish to keep our
present superiority, we must follow up vigorously this principle in
all its universality. To the cavils of ignorance and bigotry against
such a mode of proceeding we would answer, in the words of one of
the most enlightened members of the present administration, “This
country cannot stand still, whilst others are advancing in science,
in
<span class="xxpn" id="p038">[p038]</span>
industry, in every thing which contributes to increase the
power of empires, and to multiply the means of comfort and enjoyment
to civilized man.”<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-22" href="#fn-22">22</a></p>

<p>It is to be hoped, therefore, that His Royal Highness the Lord High
Admiral will extend to this most important national institution, the
School of Naval Architecture, the same vigilant and scrutinizing
eye that every other branch of our naval system is at this moment
experiencing from him, and that he will extend to it that fair play
and encouragement which has hitherto been denied to it. As a seaman,
he can fully appreciate and understand how much the bad qualities of
a ship may neutralize the best exertions of the most experienced and
skilful sailor; and, on the contrary, what a degree of confidence
may be insured in naval operations with excellent ships. We feel
persuaded, therefore, that he will not allow others to think for him
in a matter of so much national importance, and thus allow private
ends to interpose to the disadvantage of public views; but that he
will investigate and judge for himself. We would humbly suggest to
His Royal Highness to inquire into the individual acquirements and
productions, both of a <em class="italic">theoretical</em> and <em class="italic">practical</em> nature, of those
who have been educated in this establishment, and he would soon be
able to decide whether they be fitting or not for the important task
of constructing our ships, and for the confidence and protection
which we think we have shown has hitherto been ill-advisedly withheld
from them. Such a line of conduct would very soon carry our naval
architecture to a pitch of excellence <em class="italic">worthy</em> of imitation, and
instead of being indebted to foreigners for models, we should be
able, with just pride, to point to the productions of British science
and intellect in this noble art.</p>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">H<span>AVING</span></span>
pointed out, in the former paper on this subject, the nature
of the soils or places, of whatever description, by which malaria is
generated, it remains to notice a few other circumstances connected
with its natural history, a knowledge of which is essential for
the purposes of prevention; and finally to describe such modes of
prevention, applicable to these several circumstances, as have
been found useful in guarding against the attack of diseases from
this cause. Under the first head, there remain to be considered,
the effects of climate and season; the changes which occur in the
production and propagation of malaria, from various natural and
artificial causes; and also, the various modes in which it is
propagated.</p>

<p>It has already been remarked, that a certain elevation of temperature
was necessary to the production of this poison, though what the
precise degree is, has not been ascertained; and as this is, chiefly,
what distinguishes the regions or periods of the year which generate
malaria, I need not make two divisions of season and climate. If,
however, this temperature is not fixed, it will perhaps suffice
for our present purposes to say that the greater part of Scotland,
whether as to climate or season, seems incapable of generating the
disease from this cause; though there are exceptions of a permanent
nature, or exceptions of climate, as was perennially true of the
Carse of Gowrie before its drainage; while there are others which
happen when, as in the last year, there has been a peculiarly hot
summer, and which are exceptions of season.</p>

<p>And thus it is as to more northern regions; where a hot summer
becomes more than an equivalent for an average low temperature;
as an example of which, there is no place where intermittents are
more severe and abundant than at Stockholm. But the extreme of evil
from this cause occurs, as is well known, in the tropical climates;
appearing almost proportioned to the heat of the climate, and what is
important to observe to the moisture also. The destructive effects of
certain parts of Africa, India, America, and so forth, are familiarly
known; and
<span class="xxpn" id="p040">[p040]</span>
it is in these countries especially, that the
diseases from this source constitute nearly the entire mortality of
the human race. And thus, for Europe, it is in Spain, Italy, and
Greece, and chiefly on their Mediterranean shores, that the activity
of malaria scarcely yields to that of the intertropical climates;
while in France, Holland, Germany, Hungary, and with us, in a far
less degree, the production will be found regulated by the heat of
the summers, all other circumstances being the same.</p>

<p>And if we thus account for the variations in the quantity and
virulence of diseases in any given country, for noted seasons of
epidemic in the countries which I have just named, and for the great
prevalence of fevers among ourselves during the last few years, and
particularly in the last summer, there is another point of scarcely
inferior importance to be taken into the consideration, independently
of that which relates to peculiar winds as connected with the
propagation of this poison;—and this is, moisture.</p>

<p>I need not repeat that water in some form is necessary to the
production of that peculiar vegetable decomposition which is the
source of this poison; and so true is this, that even in the
tropical regions, the diseases from this cause are nearly unknown in
districts of peculiar dryness, as they are in the drier seasons of
those countries. Thus, for example, Egypt is free from such fevers,
except at the period of the subsidence of the Nile, unless where,
as at Damietta, the cultivation of rice is pursued; and the same is
true of Mesopotamia very remarkably: and if I dare not extend these
illustrations, I must remark that in all these cases, the action of
moisture is twofold, inasmuch as it not only accelerates vegetable
decomposition, but renders the atmosphere a fitter conductor of this
poison.</p>

<p>Taking these two causes of the increase in the quantity and in the
action of malaria, we can explain many particulars which relate
to its power in producing diseases: and as the knowledge of these
is important as far as relates to the main object of this paper,
prevention, it becomes necessary to explain them at a little more
length.</p>

<p>As to season, the simplest case is that of the intertropical
climates; and Africa offers the plainest instance among the
<span class="xxpn" id="p041">[p041]</span>
whole. There, the malaria and the fever commence at the moment the
rain falls; diminishing as the ground becomes thoroughly wetted,
and recommencing as it dries. The explanation of all this ought to
be obvious; and the same analogy governs all the hotter climates,
as, though less conspicuously, it does our own. Hence we explain,
both as to our spring and our autumn, the effects of heat following
rain, or the reverse, and the diseases which are consequent on those
changes: and thus it is, though more remarkably, in Italy, that a
rainy autumn increases the number and severity of fevers; or, if the
summer has been unusually dry, that they often do not appear till the
commencement of the autumnal, or even the winter rains. And hence,
also, even with us, the occurrence of a single rainy day or week, in
the midst of the heats, will produce fevers; while the effect of this
influence is such, that should there even be an entire rainy summer,
and the subsequent one be hot and dry, this will be attended by an
unusual production of malaria and disease.</p>

<p>And if I cannot detail all the various modes in which these
circumstances may be modified, and how their effects may vary, it
will be useful to make one remark on an error as relating to it which
is universal among us, and into which even Lind has fallen. The error
is, to think that the rain, the moisture, or the cold is itself the
cause of the diseases which follow this state of things; while it is
obviously a case analogous to that of Africa, if less severe, and the
malaria is produced by these circumstances on soils which I formerly
pointed out, and which Lind, like every one else, had neglected. But
if I must pass over many interesting and useful conclusions to be
drawn from these general principles, there is one fact which I must
notice, and it is
<span class="nowrap">this:—</span></p>

<p>In spring, the combination of heat and moisture, easily explained,
generates, most commonly, intermittents; or the effect of the malaria
at this season differs from what it does in autumn: while as the
heat advances and the ground dries, this kind of fever ceases to be
produced, a new species, or the summer remittent, taking its place
when the heat and the moisture of autumn begin to act. But under
peculiar seasons of heat and moisture with us, it sometimes occurs,
as it has done
<span class="xxpn" id="p042">[p042]</span>
within the last years, that the intermittent
season runs into the remittent one, or there is no midsummer interval
of freedom from disease; while it has also happened, and in some
parts of England in this last year, that what would have been
intermittent fever in other years has been remittent; or the common
fever has occupied the whole summer, continuously, even from March to
November, as is the case in the worst regions of southern Europe.</p>

<p>Now, under these exceptions, which I was bound to explain, the
commencement of intermittent, or of vernal ague, may be fixed about
the middle or end of March, and its termination similarly in May;
while that of remittent may be placed in the beginning of August,
and its termination with the middle or end of October. How these
periods may otherwise be affected by the more or less insalubrious
nature of the district or place, will easily be judged of by those
who will reflect for themselves on what I dare not explain, lest I
should infringe too far on my limits. All else that I can venture
on, as to this part of the question in hand, relates to the effects
of the different times of the day on the production, propagation, or
influence of malaria, and it is one which is of no small importance
in a practical view.</p>

<p>Whether the changes as to temperature and moisture which occur within
the space of twenty-four hours, affect the production or propagation
of malaria, I will not here inquire minutely, from the fear of
prolonging this very limited paper; but the general facts, as to its
effects, are these: If we commence with the sun on the meridian,
there appears, even in the worst climates, very little hazard of
fever; while in Italy, it is believed that there is, generally,
little or no hazard, except in some peculiarly pestilential places,
and under particular kinds of inattention or neglect. Either the
malaria is decomposed or destroyed by the heat, or else the air from
its dryness ceases to be a conductor; but as evening approaches,
its influence becomes powerful and dangerous, being supposed most
generally to extend all through the night; while in some parts
of that country it is a popular belief that it terminates before
midnight, or with the precipitation of the atmospheric moisture.
Whether this last opinion is true or not, the general fact explains
the popular
<span class="xxpn" id="p043">[p043]</span>
belief, and truth, respecting the poisonous
effects of dew in the hot climates; the supposed pernicious quality
of this depending evidently on the malaria by which its formation is
accompanied. And in this case it is probable that the evil arises,
not from a fresh or peculiar generation of malaria, but from the mere
fact that the moist atmosphere is a better conductor than a dry one.</p>

<p>Not to be unnecessarily minute, we thus also explain the danger of
exposure to the morning air in similar situations; the facts, as
they relate to the conducting of malaria, being the same, though the
meteorological circumstances are somewhat different. Hence, also, we
see why the grey mists which hang over wet grounds in the evening in
our own climate, are esteemed pernicious; the truth, however, being,
that they are perfectly innocent at certain seasons and in certain
places—as in the greater part of Scotland, for example, or in those
places and at those periods where malaria is not produced. The
distinction is valuable, because of the inconvenience of restrictions
on this subject, and because to know where the hazard really lies
is to reduce those, and also to prevent the infraction of rules by
not extending them beyond what is necessary; and thus also by seeing
what are the real dangers of what is called night air, we more easily
avoid them. Night air is avoided now, under a false philosophy,
because it is cold or damp, or for some other vague reason; while
the dangers from mere dampness or cold are as nothing compared to
those here pointed out; which also occur precisely where they are
least feared, namely, in warm summer evenings, after refreshing
showers, and so forth. Hence it is that fevers are produced in
summer, in rural situations, and especially perhaps amid the most
engaging scenery, by evening walks and exposure to what is naturally
considered, as it is felt to be, a balmy and refreshing sequel to
a hot day. Let this be enjoyed where it can with safety, and as it
often may; but such evening walks will not be safe in any of those
situations which I need not repeat here; after having detailed them
as I have done in the former paper. And lest I should be accused of
wishing to excite unnecessary alarm, I consider, on the contrary,
that it ought to be diminished by these remarks; because, if we
take the whole of
<span class="xxpn" id="p044">[p044]</span>
England, there is perhaps not one acre in
a hundred thousand where there is danger from night air, or from
malaria in any mode; so that to distinguish where that lies, is to
have relieved from useless fears all those who may learn to make the
distinctions under review.</p>

<p>To pass from what relates to climate and season, and to proceed to
the propagation, simply, of malaria, it is almost superfluous to
say, that its influence, as to the production of disease, is much
regulated by proximity, which implies a state of concentration or
accumulation. Hence the danger arising from vicinity; while, as I
formerly remarked, where the generating source is small, this becomes
necessary to its effect, since dilution may be expected to destroy
the power of the poison.</p>

<p>For analogous reasons, its effect in the production of disease is
increased by concentration or condensation; and such a state of
things takes place in narrow and confined valleys, or in places
surrounded by woods, or in woods themselves; in any situation, in
short, where the poison is produced, and is so sheltered from winds
that ventilation becomes difficult. And if it is probable that this
is one chief reason of the peculiarly insalubrious nature of woods
and jungles in hot climates, so is it an universal remark in Italy,
that the short valleys in which the air cannot circulate are among
the most pestilential spots. And if this explains, also, in some
measure, the bad effects of calm weather, so does it account for the
unusually pestiferous nature of rivers and lakes confined within
wood, as are those of the tropical climates, and as there are many
also in different parts of Europe. That we ourselves are not exempt
from these additional causes of the influence of malaria, would be
easily shown by many references, were it not for the reason which has
caused me to exclude them.</p>

<p>It is another important question for practice, how far and in what
manner malaria can be conveyed by the winds to places where it is not
produced, so as to act in exciting disease. That it is conveyed to
certain distances by winds is amply proved by an abundant experience,
and I may first detail a few of the most useful particulars as to
this fact. In Italy and Greece, it is observed, that where long
valleys terminate on sea shores, on which the exits of the rivers are
swampy, it is an
<span class="xxpn" id="p045">[p045]</span>
effect of the sea breeze, by crossing such
marshy ground, to convey the malaria up into the interior country,
to considerable distances, and to places which are in themselves
not insalubrious. Thus, also, does such a breeze, especially when
it is a warm wind, convey the poison up the acclivities of hills,
even to a considerable range of distance or elevation; a process
facilitated by the natural tendency of such winds to ascend. And as
a striking proof of this migration of malaria, it appears from Capt.
Smyth’s statistical account of the insalubrious villages in Sicily,
that out of more than seventy, about one-half are not seated near or
on lands producing this substance, but on acclivities, at varying
distances—thus receiving it through migration. The same is remarked
by Montfalcon of many towns in France; while in some, the place at
a distance is even more unhealthy than that which is immediately
situated in the marsh itself: and in our own country, this is equally
said to be true of the backwater at Weymouth, and of the marshes of
St. Blasey in Cornwall, acting more powerfully at some distance than
in the immediate spot.</p>

<p>With respect to the absolute distance to which the malaria can be
conveyed, it is yet an obscure circumstance, or at least the maximum
has not been fixed; but it is at least ascertained that the convent
of Camaldoli receives it from the Lake Agnano, at a distance of three
miles; while from certain naval reports, a distance of five miles
has been proved to permit its transmission,—and from an evidence
that cannot be doubted, inasmuch as it was the sudden breaking out of
fever in a healthy ship, anchored at that distance from the shore,
on the coming off of the land wind, attended by its peculiar and
well-known smell.</p>

<p>These facts are satisfactory thus far, and it would be abundantly
easy to add to them; but there is reason to suspect that it can
be conveyed to far greater distances, in certain favourable
circumstances: those reasons, in the first place, being derived from
certain meteorological analogies and considerations, and in the next
confirmed by experience. It is notorious that the ague appears on
our eastern coasts with the first east winds of spring; and while
this circumstance is most common on those of England, as for example,
in Kent, Essex, Norfolk,
<span class="xxpn" id="p046">[p046]</span>
Suffolk, and Lincolnshire, it is
not thus limited, since it is known to happen further north, and
even in Scotland, where malaria is not indigenous to the soil. It
is very true that if we take any inland position in the places thus
noted, the natural solution is, that the malaria is generated in the
very soil itself of England, and merely propagated, perhaps even to
very moderate distances, through those winds. But the occurrence of
disease cannot be explained thus, when the place in question is so
situated that there is no land to the eastward, or when the breeze
is, most literally and rigidly, a sea breeze; while, when ague thus
occurs on the east coast of Scotland, where it is not produced by the
soil, it must be imported by the east wind.</p>

<p>These are the facts; while as malaria is not produced by the sea
itself in any known circumstance, though a vegetating sea beach
may give rise to it, we must seek the cause in lands far distant,
and consider this as a case of propagation of the poison from the
shores of Holland; and those shores are unquestionably competent to
that effect: so that the only question that remains, the fact being
admitted, is, whether, <em class="italic">à priori</em>, or theoretically, such a view is
probable, or whether it is consistent with those physical principles
that are concerned in the propagation of malaria.</p>

<p>I am aware that such a view will excite the incredulity of those
who have not attended to this subject; though it appears to me that
it comprises nothing averse to our knowledge of the philosophical
circumstances concerned. In the first place, let us remark that the
east wind, and particularly the east winds of spring, are notorious
for their moisture, and that a moist air is the best conductor of
malaria, as moisture in the air, under the form of evening mists, or
in other modes, appears even to be its proper vehicle, or residence,
if I may use such a term; and though I have not as yet separated
the case of a fog, I may now remark, that the effect in question,
or the production of agues by fogs arriving from the sea, is even
more notorious than their generation by an ordinary clear wind. So
notorious and popular, indeed, is this fact, that the fog itself is
deemed the source of the disease, as the east wind under any form is,
in other circumstances; while I hope it will even now appear,
<span class="xxpn" id="p047">[p047]</span>
that the real cause lies in the malaria transported or conveyed
by those winds or fogs, and of which they are the true and best
repository and vehicle.</p>

<p>And these are the reasons for thinking that the malaria, with the
wind, may be transported to a distance as great as that which the
present view requires; most easily perhaps in a fog, but without
difficulty even in a clear wind. It is remarkable that the east wind,
as it is the most persevering, is that one also which preserves the
most steady horizontal and linear course. I have also shown, in a
former work, that it is a property of winds to travel in distinct
lines through a tranquil atmosphere, and often in streams of a very
limited breadth; that opposing streams will also move, in absolute
contact; and that even rapid streams of wind will cross each other’s
courses without difficulty. This proves that, in any such stream,
there is a principle of self-preservation or integrity, and renders
it probable that the several portions retain the same relative places
to each other, at any distance, during the career of the whole; and
there is a proof of this afforded in the fact of those columns or
streams of insects which are brought over by such winds, and very
frequently from those very countries, or from Holland and Flanders,
in the most regular order, or without disturbance or dispersion.</p>

<p>Hence it may be argued, that if a malaria, generated any where
and conveyed by the winds, can be transported to a distance of
three miles, as has been proved, there is no reason why it should
not travel much farther, or to any distance that can be assumed:
and if this be true of a clear wind, the case of a fog is even a
much stronger one; since there is little reason to doubt that the
individual parts of such fog, in any assumed mass, will retain their
relative places to each other, as perfectly after a journey of any
given number of miles, as they did at the point of production; and
if a portion of malaria has been united to a portion of fog, in the
marsh which produced both, or whence both have come, there is every
apparent reason why it should be found in that same portion at any
farther or assumed distance, because there is no cause for either its
dispersion or its decomposition.</p>

<p>A fog is a cloud, simply; and it is notorious that a single
<span class="xxpn" id="p048">[p048]</span>
cloud, and often of very small dimensions, will remain at rest
in the atmosphere, or travel very many miles without the loss of
its integrity; however we may imagine it assailed by the various
meteorological causes of destruction, as well as by mechanical
violence. This in itself proves the consistency with which a current
of wind preserves the relative positions of its integral parts;
because it is plain that a disturbance among these must disturb or
destroy the cloud which, in reality, forms a portion of that current,
as a gaseous body: and since that cloud is a mist, since it might
have been the very evening mist embodying a malaria, and since it
is its real vehicle and repository, it is plain that had it, or
any individual cloud, contained such a portion of malaria, it must
have had the power of transmitting that, and would actually have
transported it to any distance to which itself might travel. Thus, it
is evident, may a fog, generated in Holland, carry without difficulty
to the limits of its range, or to the coast of England, that malaria
which became entangled with it at its birth-place or in its passage;
and thus, I have little doubt, is the fact of those agues explained,
and this transportation to such distances established.</p>

<p>I cannot, at least, conceive any demonstration as to facts of this
nature more convincing, nor anything wanting to the proof; while
I may proceed to make some remarks on the east wind, and on fogs,
simply, because they concern this question.</p>

<p>The proof that it is a malaria in the fog, and not the fog itself,
which is the cause of disease, is evinced by the following fact;
while it ought surely to be unnecessary to say, that if fog alone
could produce such fever, water itself must be the poison: since a
fog is a cloud, and its constituents, when pure, are only atmospheric
air and water. No intermittents are ever produced on the western or
northern shores by the sea fogs, and for the plain reason, that there
is no land whence they arrive. The clouds of mountainous regions
do not produce fevers, though these also are fogs; and what forms
a most absolute proof of this is, that in Flanders, it is the fogs
which come with a southwest wind, or the southerly winds themselves,
which transport and propagate malaria and disease; while; as soon as
the winds shift, and blow from the sea, the fevers
<span class="xxpn" id="p049">[p049]</span>
disappear,
though those particular winds are so charged with fog, as to darken
the whole country for days: and it will be found an invariable rule
all over the world, that when a fog is the apparent cause of disease,
or when an east wind is such, it is because these have been generated
in a land of marshes, or have traversed one; and that, under other
circumstances, or where no pernicious land lies in the way, they are
as innocent as any other fogs and winds, and that the hazard and the
suffering will arise from those, be they whatever they may, which
traverse pestilential lands.</p>

<p>But I must defer this particular and interesting subject to another
occasion, lest I make this article too long; and proceed to examine
some other circumstances connected with the transportation of malaria.</p>

<p>First, however, I must notice one fact as to this transportation from
Holland, partly because it is a necessary fact in the history of
malaria, and partly because it might be used as an argument against
the view which I have just given. The east winds of autumn are not
supposed to bring remittents, as those of spring bring agues, though
I cannot assert that this is absolutely true. Being assumed, the
solution is easy. If the winds of this nature in spring, are notedly
moist, and thus vehicles of malaria, the case is exactly the reverse
with the east winds of summer and autumn; or as the east wind may
be the most moist of winds, so may it be the most dry; while it is
a consequence of its extreme dryness, in fact, that it is always
the very cause of our burning summers. This is the history of our
last summers, and it is invariable, whether as it relates to seasons
or single days; and it is plainly owing to its permitting the more
ready transmission of the sun’s rays. That it is the very harmattan
of Africa, it is almost unnecessary to say; and as dry wind is not
a conductor of malaria, as that poison is in fact decomposed or
destroyed in these circumstances, daily and invariably, it is easy to
see why the remittents of Holland should not be transported, like its
intermittents, though even this may possibly happen under particular
circumstances.</p>

<p>To proceed; and to the next remarkable facts connected with
the propagation of malaria.—The most singular of these is its
limitation, or that yet unexplained property by which it is
<span class="xxpn" id="p050">[p050]</span>
determined in a particular direction, or confined to a particular
spot, while it is a piece of knowledge of some practical value.
There is an appearance of incredibility about many of these facts,
and, accordingly, they have not only been disbelieved but ridiculed,
although nothing in the whole history of this substance is better
established.</p>

<p>With respect to direction, in the first place, it is remarked in
Italy, currently, that this poison will enter the lower stories of
houses, particularly with open windows, when the next above escape;
and hence, in many places, no one ventures to sleep on ground floors:
and the truth of this was confirmed in the barracks at Jamaica by Dr.
Hunter; as the cases of fever occurring among the men in the lower
rooms much exceeded those which happened in the upper ones. But I
am also informed, that in some places in Norfolk this peculiarity
is reversed; or that there are houses where it is remarked that the
ground-floors are safe, while no one can sleep in the upper stories
without hazard.</p>

<p>That malaria may in some manner be attached to the soil is also well
known by its effects, and especially in Italy. There it is remarked
that it is extremely hazardous to cut down certain bushy plants which
appear to entangle it, and that fevers are a frequent consequence of
such carelessness. Thus, also, does fever seize on the labourers who
may incautiously sit down on the ground, while they would escape in
the erect posture; being thus, indeed, sometimes suddenly struck with
apoplexy, which is one of the effects of this poison, or even with
death.</p>

<p>It has similarly been observed that it is often retained in the
shelter of drains, or in the ditches of fortifications; whence
frequent fevers among the sentries on particular guards, when the
other soldiers escape. And thus was it even proved at Malta, that it
was transported from the sea-shore, and thus lodged in a dry ditch of
the works at Valetta; all these facts being possibly to be explained,
by supposing it possessed of a greater specific gravity than the
atmosphere, or else attached to vapour thus weighty, exhibiting
effects analogous to those which carbonic acid displays in the
Solfatara.</p>

<p>But the circumstance most difficult of explanation is, that in
Rome, and numerous places in Italy, and even where it is
<span class="xxpn" id="p051">[p051]</span>
transported from a distance by the winds, not generated on the spot,
it is found, perennially, and through the whole course of successive
years, to occupy certain places, and to avoid, as constantly, others
quite near, and, as far as the eye can judge, equally exposed, and
in all respects similar. Thus, one side of a small garden, one side
of a street, or one house, will be for ever exposed to disease, or
uninhabitable, when, at a few feet or yards distant, the very same
places are as constantly free of danger: and thus it was found at the
village of Faro, in Sicily, that all the troops of our army quartered
on one side of the single street which formed it, were affected
by fevers, and suffered great mortality, while those on the other
remained in health.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable case of this nature known to me, is a
domestic one, and which rests on the testimony of thousands of
persons, or of the whole country, however incredible it may appear.
It is, that between Chatham and Brighton, including every town and
single house, and Sittingbourne among the rest, the ague affects the
left hand side of the turnpike road, or the northern side, and does
not touch the right side, though the road itself forms the only line
of separation.</p>

<p>We cannot as yet conjecture the cause of this very singular
circumstance or property, at least in cases of this nature;
though, under certain events of this kind, there are some facts
in meteorology that may offer a solution. These are the notorious
ones, that a hoar frost, or a dew, will sometimes be found most
accurately limited, both vertically and horizontally, by a definite
line; stopping, for example, at a particular hedge, and reaching to a
certain altitude on a tree: but for the other cases, we must yet wait
for a period of more accurate knowledge as to this singular substance.</p>

<p>There is now one circumstance of importance, relating to the
destruction or decomposition of malaria, which must not be passed
over, from the interest of the facts depending on it: this is,
that its propagation is checked by the streets of a crowded town,
and apparently owing to this very cause, decomposition. Thus it is
observed, that the fever never appears in the Judaicum of Rome, and,
similarly, that the crowded streets and the poor people escape, when
the opulent houses and open
<span class="xxpn" id="p052">[p052]</span>
streets are attacked; and hence
the Villa Borghese, among many other palaces and opulent houses
in Rome, has been abandoned, while such desertion, being limited
exclusively to houses where the air is most open and free, naturally
excites wonder: the cause, however, is now plain; and thus it now
appears why it was that the Penitentiary in Westminster suffered
formerly from dysentery, originating in this cause, when no such
disease appeared among the neighbouring inhabitants.</p>

<p>And if this fact is of value as it may relate to the erection of open
streets in any place of this nature, it is most important to point
out what has been the continuous effect at Rome, as the ultimate
consequences threaten to be extremely serious.</p>

<p>It appears that from cutting down some forests which many years ago
occupied the declivities of the hills to the southward of Rome, the
malaria was let in upon that city from the Pontine marshes; and,
further, that the extirpation of a similar wood to the eastward had
let in the same poison upon another quarter. Thus it has been found
to enter the city through the Porta del Popolo, while, for many
years past, it has been gradually extending its influence through
the streets; leading annually and successively to the abandonment of
many houses and palaces, and still annually increasing and extending
its ravages; so as, at length, as I understand, to have even
become sensible at the Vatican. And the lines which it follows are
distinctly traced out by the inhabitants; while, as I have already
said, it is only the houses of the opulent which suffer, further than
as the abandonment of these may also influence the inferior ones in
their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Whatever the original cause may be, and however the direction,
abstractedly, may be regulated by the winds and the forms of the
streets, or by local and fixed circumstances, it is plain that the
annual extension is the consequence of desertion, and that as the
inhabitants retire from before it, it acquires the means of making
a new step and a further progress; because thus they withdraw
those fires and smoke, or whatever else it be, dependent on human
crowds, which decomposes and destroys this substance. And hence it
must follow, that as Rome shall become still further abandoned and
depopulated, from want of industry, or from political feebleness
<span class="xxpn" id="p053">[p053]</span>
added to this cause, the effects must be expected to increase
in a sort of geometrical ratio; almost leading to the fear that
the whole city itself may, in time, fall a victim to it, or become
abandoned to the wolves and mosquitoes.</p>

<p>If I dare not inquire more minutely into the remaining circumstances
connected with the propagation of malaria, lest I should extend this
article to an inconvenient length, it is necessary now to offer
some remarks on prevention, and especially as it relates to this
circumstance—the propagation of the poison; since the rules for
prevention, as far as this relates to production, may be deduced from
what was said in a former paper on this subject, and relate chiefly
to the drainage of lands, and to other practices, more or less
obvious, which a little reflection will, without much difficulty,
deduce from what was there said.</p>

<p>It is plain, in the first place, that as far as the winds are
concerned, it is by opposing obstacles to their course that we must
attempt to counteract or divert their influence; and that, in this
case, it is through the use of trees alone that we possess any power.
Thus reversely, as in the case just stated, the cutting down of trees
and forests has often been a serious cause of diseases in certain
countries, by admitting a malaria to particular spots; though it is
easy to see that where any given spot suffers from malaria, through
condensation or confinement, the clearing away of these would be the
remedy, by attaining a free ventilation. To detail the particular
modes in which remedies may be applied through this species of aid,
is obviously unnecessary, and not easy, as it must depend on local
circumstances, differing for each place; but I may remark, as an
example in illustration of my meaning, that where, as in many of the
narrow and prolonged valleys of Greece, the sea shore is a marsh,
the remedy would be to plant a screen of trees beyond it, and thus
to prevent the sea winds from passing into the interior. And thus
did the ancient Romans compel the planting of trees on the shores
of Latium, to check the current from the Pontine marshes; rendering
groves sacred, under heavy penalties, and enacting other laws with
the same intentions.</p>

<p>With respect to such temporary precautions in these cases
<span class="xxpn" id="p054">[p054]</span>
as
may concern armies in the field, or in camps, it is plain that they
will depend on attention to the courses and seasons of the winds;
while it would be abundantly easy to accumulate, from the histories
of campaigns, the most fearful examples of mortality produced by
neglect of these and similar precautions, and even down to almost
the very date at which I am writing: and there can be no hesitation
in saying, that an intimate and accurate knowledge of every thing
which concerns the production and propagation of malaria, forms a
most important branch in that information necessary to a soldier,
and above all to the quarter-master-general’s department and the
medical staff: while, did I dare to record but a very small portion
of the mortality experienced, not only in our own armies, but in
those of Europe at large, during even the last war, from ignorance
or neglect on this subject, it would, I believe, be found that it
almost equalled the mortality produced by the actual collision of
war itself. Walcheren will not soon be forgotten; if we have ceased
to think of our mortal Havannah expedition; and if a French army at
Naples was diminished by twenty thousand men, out of twenty-four, in
four days, from this cause; if Orloff lost nearly his entire army in
Paros; if Hungary has more than once destroyed ten times the number
of men by fever that it did by the sword,—these are but trifles in
the mass of reasons for saying, that no subject can well be more
important, and no knowledge much more necessary to the commander of
an army.</p>

<p>Some other points relating to prevention may deserve a few words
of notice, before I pass from this subject; if here, also, I must
be brief. Not to repeat the cautions founded on what relates to
the power of evening and morning, it has been asserted that the
use of a gauze veil will prevent the effect of malaria; and it is
not improbable that the air accumulated within that, may have the
power of decomposing the poison: it is an opinion, at least, which
is universal among the people in Malta, and very general in Spain
and Portugal. It is also found that fires and smoke are useful, and
especially on military service; the experiment having been tried on
a very large scale by Napoleon before Mantua, and on a smaller one
in Africa, with the most perfect success. With respect to
<span class="xxpn" id="p055">[p055]</span>
personal precautions, it is universally recommended to use wine and
a good diet, and especially never to leave the house in the evening
in situations peculiarly insalubrious, without the previous use of
wine or spirits; whence the universal practice of Holland in this
respect. Thus, also, narcotics prevent its influence; whence the wide
use of tobacco, of which the salutary effects appear to be most amply
established.</p>

<p>As to the tropical countries, there is here also one important
remark, which, from the great neglect of the fact, and its ruinous
consequences, appear particularly to demand a statement in this
place. It is the universal experience of the inhabitants, that the
attack of malaria, or the production of fevers, is aided by the use
of a full or animal diet; by the use of some particular articles of
food, such as butter; by excess in eating, generally; and, above all,
by eating in the heat of the day. This is not merely well known to
the negroes, but the fact is distinctly stated to travellers, and the
caution urged, however often it has been neglected, and especially
by our own countrymen. Of this, in particular, Major Denham is a
strong testimony; while he attributes his own exclusive preservation
to his having rigidly followed the recommendations of the natives,
which were always urged with the greatest earnestness. And if we
examine the causes of death, in most cases, of our African travellers
especially, I think there will be strong reasons for believing that
their lives have often been sacrificed to this very negligence
or obstinacy; while it is most evident that Niebuhr’s party, in
particular, owed the loss of their lives to what may be safely called
gluttony: and it is to be suspected that this will also explain the
loss of Captain Tuckey’s party; while, with respect to nations, it
has long been known that the English, the Dutch, and the northern
voracious people in general, who habitually indulge themselves in the
customs of their original country as tropical colonists, have always
been greater sufferers from the effects of those climates than the
French and the Spaniards, and apparently from this very difference.
And there seems little doubt, generally, that the vegetable diet of
Africa and Hindostan is the best security against the evil influence
of those climates, and that the chief sufferings of our
<span class="xxpn" id="p056">[p056]</span>
own
colonists arise from transferring to those situations their ancient
habits of full and free living.</p>

<p>As I must not prolong this subject much further, I shall now pass to
a few remarks, but very brief ones, on the geography of malaria as
it relates to those parts of the continent of Europe most frequented
by English travellers; not daring to take room for actual and
useful information on that head, but wishing to point out merely
the importance of such geographical knowledge to those persons, on
account of the hazards which they so universally incur from that
ignorance or neglect, and of the great mass of suffering, and also
of mortality, which has been the lot of persons who had resorted to
those climates as travellers, or migrating residents, from various
motives, and not unfrequently with views to health. How often health
has been lost where it was sought, will be but too apparent to any
one who has chanced to possess an extensive acquaintance of this
nature.</p>

<p>Of Italy I can but afford to say generally, that except at a very
few points where the Alps or Apennines reach the sea, the whole of
its shores are pestilential, and often to such a degree as to lead
to their entire desertion, more frequently to their abandonment
in summer. And to avoid wet lands, or low lands, is not always a
sufficient precaution; since the most pestilential parts of the
maremma of Tuscany are dry, and since the annual mortality of Sienna
from fevers, even without epidemics, is one in ten. In the north of
Italy, the great plain is similarly insalubrious; though the more
unhealthy district does not commence until we arrive at Mantua,
extending thence to the sea. Of the Mediterranean islands, I can
only afford room to say, that the same rule holds good as to the
sea coasts, while the entire of Greece in the same circumstances
is similarly unhealthy, and subject to autumnal fevers in as great
a degree as the worst parts of Italy. The same is true of Spain
and Portugal, and the same rule also will be a guide; namely, that
malaria is to be expected in all the flat grounds, even when under
cultivation, and at all the exits of rivers on the sea, even though
no marshes should be present: and if I were desirous to name any
tract of land in Spain peculiarly
<span class="xxpn" id="p057">[p057]</span>
insalubrious, it would be
the province of Valencia; while Carthagena is almost invariably fatal
even to those who, as labourers, are compelled to resort to it for
the needful work of its port, even during a few days.</p>

<p>Of France, little as it has hitherto been suspected by those who,
associating the term malaria with Italy, have been accustomed to
consider it as peculiar to that country, it would scarcely be untrue
to say that it contains as large a portion of insalubrious territory
as Italy itself, and produces fever and disease of as great severity
and extent, not merely on its sea coasts, but over very extensive
tracts in its interior. And this insalubrity may be conjectured,
when there are entire districts in which the average of life does
not exceed twenty, and in which the entire people are diseased from
their births to their graves. Such tracts are found chiefly on the
course of the Loire, and some other of the great rivers; and among
them, Bresse in the Lyonnais, the plain of Forez, and Sologne in the
Orleannais, are of the most notorious; while the coasts of Normandy,
and the whole of low Britanny, are similarly subject to eternal
intermittents, or to epidemic seasons of autumnal fevers, amounting
to absolute pestilences. And how English families have suffered in
this country from the incautious choice of residences in such places,
will be easily ascertained by whoever shall be at the trouble of
making the necessary inquiries.</p>

<p>But as I dare not pursue this extensive subject, I can only suggest
to our countrymen the utility of making themselves acquainted with
this matter, and with this dangerous geography, before encountering
the hazards which await them; while to physicians I need still less
name the necessity of that knowledge, since it is so often their
duty to choose and recommend for their patients, and since no man
can feel much at his ease who finds that he has sent into a land of
malaria the patient who has already been suffering from its diseases,
or that where he speculates on the cure of a consumption, that
cure is attained through the death of the patient, at Avignon, or
at Poitiers, or Nantes, or in some or other of the numerous places
subject to this most fearful poison.</p>

<p>It remains only to give a brief enumeration of the diseases
<span class="xxpn" id="p058">[p058]</span>
which are the produce of malaria, and of the general condition of
the inhabitants in the countries subject to it. With respect to this
latter, the most remarkable general fact is the contracted duration
of life. In England, the average may, if not very accurately, and
indeed considerably under the mark, be taken at 50; and when in
Holland it is but 25, it follows that the half of human life is
at once cut off by this destructive agent. In the parts of France
to which I have alluded, it becomes as low as 22 and 20, and
Condorcet, indeed, has calculated it as low as 18. With this, very
few attain the age of 50; and in appearance and strength, this
term is equivalent to 80 in ordinary climates; while 40 forms the
general limit of extreme and rare old age. The period of age, indeed,
commences after 20; and it is remarked, in particular, that the
females become old in appearance immediately after 17, and have, even
at 20, the aspect of old women. In many places, even the children are
diseased from their birth; while the life which is dragged on by the
whole population, is a life of perpetual disease, and most frequently
of inveterate and incurable intermittents, or of a constant febrile
state, with debility, affections of the stomach, dropsy, and far more
than I need here enumerate.</p>

<p>While the countenances of the people in those countries are sallow
or yellow, and often livid, they are frequently so emaciated as
to appear like walking spectres, though the abdomen is generally
enlarged, in consequence either of visceral affections or dropsy.
With these, rickets, varices, hernia, and, in females, chlorosis,
together with scorbutic diseases, ulcers, and so forth, are common;
and it is even to be suspected that the cretinage may depend on this
cause, since goitre is also one of the results of malaria, and since,
in the Maremma of Tuscany, idiotism is a noted consequence of this
pestilential influence.</p>

<p>The general mental condition is no less remarkable; since it consists
in an universal apathy, recklessness, indolence, and melancholy,
added to a fatalism which prevents them from even desiring to better
their condition, or to avoid such portion of the evils around them
as care and attention might diminish: and while it is asserted that
even the moral character becomes
<span class="xxpn" id="p059">[p059]</span>
similarly depraved, I prefer
a reference to Montfalcon for a picture which it would not be very
agreeable to transcribe.</p>

<p>As to the absolute or positive diseases, besides those which I have
already named, I need scarcely say that remittent and intermittent
fevers, under endless varieties and types, form the great mass; and
next in order to them, may be placed dysentery and cholera, together
with diarrhœa. To these I must also add, those painful diseases of
the nerves, of which sciatica stands foremost, and the remainder of
which may be ranked under the general term of neuralgia; and further,
a considerable number of inflammatory diseases of a more or less
remittent type, among which rheumatism under various forms is the
most general, and the intermittent ophthalmia the most remarkable.
Lastly, I must include the various paralytic affections; since
apoplexy is one of the primary and direct consequences of malaria, as
various paralytic affections are the produce of intermittent, or the
consequences of the diseases of the nerves which are associated with
it.</p>

<p>It is still a curious and interesting fact, that this poison affects,
in an analogous manner, many different animals, and appears, in
reality, to be the cause of all the noted endemics and remarkable
epidemics which occur in the agricultural animals in particular.
This has been noticed even by Livy: and in France and Italy it is
equally familiar that the severe seasons of fever among the people
are similarly seasons of epidemics to black-cattle and sheep,
while the symptoms are as nearly the same as they could be in the
circumstances, and the appearances on dissection also correspond.
Thus also does it appear probable, that the rot in sheep is actually
the produce of malaria, as is indeed the received opinion among
French veterinarians; while Mr. Royston has observed that the animals
of this class are subject to distinct intermittents.</p>

<p class="clearfix">And while it is not less familiar in the West Indies, and in Dominica
particularly, that dogs suffer from a mortal fever in the same
seasons and periods as the people, the epidemic always breaking out
in them first, I have the most unexceptionable medical evidence of
the occurrence of a regular and well-marked tertian in a dog; that
evidence consisting in the concurring decision of many surgeons, by
whom the case was
<span class="xxpn" id="p060">[p060]</span>
frequently examined, during a very long
period. But it is time to terminate a paper, which, if it is but a
sketch of an important subject, will at least convey to those to
whom malaria has not hitherto been an object of attention, a general
notion of the leading particulars which appertain to its natural
history.<span class="signaturefloat">J. M.</span></p>

<h3 class="hleft"><em class="italic">Elements of Chemistry, including
the recent Discoveries and
Doctrines of the Science. By</em> Edward Turner, M.D., F.R.S.E., &#38;c.,

<a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">T<span>HIS</span></span>
is a closely-printed octavo of 700 pages, and presents us with
something more original, clear, and accurate than we have lately met
with in modern chemistry. It comprehends a perspicuous view of the
present state of chemical science; and, as far as its limits admit,
the theoretical parts are, with some exceptions, well and distinctly
worked out; nor are the practical details of manipulation neglected,
though they evidently occupy a secondary place in our author’s
estimation. To the arrangement we must at once decidedly object—it
is indeed evident that Dr. Turner has pitched upon Dr. Thomas Thomson
as his <em class="italic">magnus Apollo</em>, and here and elsewhere the book is tainted
accordingly.</p>

<p>This work is divided into four principal parts;—the first relates
to what Dr. Turner, following his prototype, Dr. Thomson, calls
<em class="italic">imponderables</em>, and a definition of them follows, which leads
us to suggest the term <em class="italic">inexpressibles</em>, as equally appropriate.
But, waiving this objection, the details relating to them are well
and clearly given. Thus, after some prefatory remarks upon the
subject of caloric or heat, (we prefer the latter term, and cannot
allow its ambiguity,) its modes of communication are considered,
first, as being <em class="italic">conducted</em> through bodies, and then as <em class="italic">radiating</em>
through free space. In regard to the theories affecting the
latter, our author wisely, as we think, prefers that of Prevost
to that of Pictet. The <em class="italic">effects</em> of heat are next discussed, such
as <em class="italic">expansion</em>, including an account of the thermometer, and
of the relative capacities of bodies for heat; <em class="italic">liquefaction</em>,
<em class="italic">vaporisation</em>, <em class="italic">ebullition</em>, <em class="italic">evaporation</em>, and the <em class="italic">constitution of
gases</em> and lastly, the sources of heat are mentioned, but the details
are referred to other parts of the work.
<span class="xxpn" id="p061">[p061]</span></p>

<p><em class="italic">Light</em> is next treated of, but we think too hastily, and too much in
the abstract.</p>

<p>Now the subjects of heat and light are obviously of the utmost
importance to the chemical philosopher, and they are very extensive,
and intricate and difficult to treat of, inasmuch as the writer is
necessarily upon the confines of chemical and mechanical philosophy,
and should be expert in both. When, therefore, elementary works on
chemistry are so written and arranged as to serve as text-books for
lectures, and indexes of reference to more accurate information, we
can make due allowance for brevity; but when the subject is intended
to be formally and completely developed to the student, independent
of other ocular and oral aids, much more extensive description and
detailed explanation is required, than is to be found either in
our author’s “Elements,” or in any other analogous condensation of
chemistry. Dr. Henry understands the requisite mode of conveying
information in these cases better than most writers; and when he
takes pains, and speaks for himself, has the talent of being brief,
and at the same time minute, deep, and clear. Dr. Ure, as his
dictionary shows, is an eminent example of such a writer—<em class="italic">he</em> of
course is neglected, where, as with our author, Dr. Thomson is in the
ascendant; but the article caloric, in his dictionary, will at once
explain and illustrate our meaning, and would furnish an admirable
foundation for a detailed essay or treatise upon the subject. So
extensive, indeed, are the precincts of chemistry now becoming, that
either our <em class="italic">systems</em> must become very voluminous, or we must adopt
the plan, which to us appears preferable, of distinct treatises upon
different branches of the science. Thus, a separate work on heat and
light; another on electricity and magnetism; another on attraction
and the theory of combination; a fourth on the constitution and
properties of the unmetallic elementary bodies; a fifth on the metals
and their compounds; a sixth on vegetable, and a seventh on animal
chemistry and physiology; an eighth on the chemistry of the arts;
and lastly, a treatise on chemical manipulation in general, would
include all that appears essentially requisite; and as no one is
supposed to be equally well versed in all branches of the science, or
in all details of the art, an opportunity of selection would thus be
afforded, so that each writer might choose that particular department
which he is most accurately acquainted with, or which has formed
his favourite study. Mr. Faraday has already, as may be said, led
the way in such a plan, by the publication of his <em class="italic">Chemical
<span class="xxpn" id="p062">[p062]</span>
Manipulation</em>, a work hitherto exceedingly wanted in the laboratory,
equally useful to the proficient and to the student, and eminently
creditable to the industry and skill of the author, and to the school
whence it emanates. We shall of course take an early opportunity of
introducing this book in a more formal way to the attention of our
chemical readers.</p>

<p>In looking over Dr. Turner’s first and second sections on caloric and
light, in the <em class="italic">Elements</em> now before us, we find little but brevity
to complain of;—there are, however, one or two trifling historical
inaccuracies: thus, at page 14, the discovery of <em class="italic">invisible</em> heating
rays is ascribed to Saussure and Pictet; but it is, in fact, of much
more remote origin—it was well known to the Florentine academicians,
and we may even trace the idea in Lucretius, (<em class="italic">De Rerum Naturâ</em>, lib,
v. 1, 609.)</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p>Forsitan et rosea Sol alte lampade lucens</p>

<p>Circum se, <em class="italic">nullo qui sit fulgore notatus, &#38;c.</em></p>
</div></div>

<p>At page 31 we have an account of Wedgwood’s pyrometer, which is said
to be “little employed at present, because its indications cannot be
relied on;”—the fact is, that it is never used, and that we owe to
Sir James Hall ample reasons for placing no confidence in it.</p>

<p>The subject of <em class="italic">specific heat</em> is clearly explained, and so are
the phenomena of liquefaction and evaporation. In regard to the
constitution of gases, the author remarks, that the experiments
of Sir H. Davy and Mr. Faraday on the liquefaction of gaseous
substances, appear to justify the opinion that gases are merely the
vapours of extremely volatile liquids. Mr. Faraday has proved this
in regard to several of the gases, and analogy leads us to apply it
to the rest;—but what share Sir H. Davy had in the discovery, we
know not; for Mr. Faraday actually condensed chlorine into a liquid
before Sir H. had heard or thought about the matter. <em class="italic">Light</em>, and
its phenomena as connected with chemistry, is superficially passed
over in the second section, and the third brings us to the important
article “Electricity.”</p>

<p>We are willing to admit that the subject of electricity is a very
difficult one for the chemist to deal with—he must necessarily say
much upon it, and is equally obliged to omit abstract details which
are often necessary to its explanation, and yet too prolix and bulky
for an elementary chemical work. So that it requires considerable
acquaintance with the subject to give a perspicuous and yet concise
abstract,
<span class="xxpn" id="p063">[p063]</span>
such as may be useful to the student. Dr. Turner
has not been very successful in effecting this <em class="italic">desideratum</em>, and
has unnecessarily introduced two sections, the one on electricity,
the other on galvanism. He also talks of the “science of galvanism,”
which is in bad taste, and erroneously asserts that the energy of the
pile is proportional to the degree of chemical action which takes
place; a statement by no means correct, inasmuch as the energy of De
Luc’s column is directly proportional to the number of alternations,
and appears entirely independent of chemical action; and again, a
series of 2000 plates, arranged in the usual Voltaic apparatus, when
perfectly bright and clean, and the cells filled with distilled water
only, give a much more powerful shock, and cause a greater divergence
of the leaves of the electrometer than when the apparatus is charged
with diluted acids. Here, those very singular phenomena, which
electricians distinguish by the terms <em class="italic">quantity</em> and <em class="italic">intensity</em>,
appear perfectly distinct; and between these our author does not
sufficiently discriminate, but jumbles the whole under the term
<em class="italic">activity</em>. In describing the chemical energies, too, of the pile, or
its decomposing powers, the Doctor entirely overlooks the important
and curious influence of water. He says that acids and salts are all
decomposed, without exception, one of their elements appearing at one
side of the battery, and the other at its opposite extremity; (<em class="italic">i.
e.</em> we presume, at its positive and negative poles.) But the fact is,
that, excepting where it merely acts as a source of heat, nothing
is decomposable by electricity without the intervention of water;
the hydrogen and oxygen of which respectively accompany the elements
of the other compounds. Not an atom of potassium can be obtained
unless the potassa be moistened; nor can any salt be decomposed
except water be present. Sir Humphry says, it is required, to render
the substance a conductor; but its operation is more recondite, and
there is something mysterious and still unexplained in the uniform
appearance of hydrogen and oxygen at the opposite poles, when far
apart in water, and in all other cases of true polar electro-chemical
decomposition. At page 86, the unfortunate protectors of ships’
bottoms are introduced—a subject about which the less is said the
better;—and, as to electro-magnetism, it is merely mentioned as
to its leading phenomena, in the space of three or four pages; nor
is anything new suggested upon the “Theory of the Pile,” as it is
called, which concludes the subject, and which is dismissed in the
brief limit of a page and a half.
<span class="xxpn" id="p064">[p064]</span></p>

<p>The second part of Dr. Turner’s work is said to comprise “Inorganic
Chemistry,” and therefore embraces a very extensive field of inquiry.
To the <em class="italic">arrangement</em> we have already objected; and many of the
typographical and verbal errors that occur, have been noticed in a
contemporary Journal, so that we shall chiefly attend to the details
of the sections.</p>

<p>Under the head, “Affinity,” some of the leading facts and doctrines
of chemical attraction are perspicuously set forth; but we could have
wished that a variety of exploded opinions and erroneous notions had
been altogether passed over, as they occupy space which might have
been better employed, and can never prove of any other use to the
student than to show him the errors and fallacies to which acute
philosophers are sometimes liable. Of this kind, especially, are
Berthollet’s notions upon the subject of affinity. The doctrine of
definite proportion is, on the whole, well and clearly explained; but
it would have been much better and clearer, had Dr. Turner confined
himself to facts, and meddled less with opinions concerning their
cause; he is moreover, in many respects, historically inaccurate. He
ascribes much to Dalton that honestly belongs to Higgins;—is much
too merciful to Berzelius and his
<span class="smcaps">C<span>ANONS</span></span>; and lenient beyond all
endurance to the plagiarisms of “Dr. Thomson’s admirable Treatise on
the first Principles of Chemistry.”</p>

<p>In the third and following sections, the simple non-metallic
substances are described in an order of arrangement which must be
very perplexing to the student; otherwise the details are well
given, except that here and there the line between theory and fact
is not sufficiently marked. Thus we are told that “hydrogen is
exactly 16 times lighter than oxygen, and <em class="italic">therefore</em> that 100 cubic
inches <em class="italic">must</em> weigh
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">33.888</span><span class="fdn">16</span></span>,</span>
or 2.118. Its specific gravity is
consequently 0.0694, as stated some years ago by Dr. Prout.” Now this
is a theoretical deduction, founded upon the specific gravity and
constitution of ammonia, (and not upon the composition of water,) and
probably correct as applied to <em class="italic">pure</em> hydrogen;—but if we weigh the
gas, as usually obtained, even with the utmost caution, and of the
utmost purity, we shall never procure it so light as here stated,
notwithstanding all the learning and argument that our worthy friend,
Dr. Thomas Thomson, has issued upon the subject in his various
essays in the Annals, and in his <em class="italic">magnum opus</em>. We also object to
the stress which is often laid upon the whims of individuals, and
upon
<span class="xxpn" id="p065">[p065]</span>
exploded opinions; instances of which will occur to the
reader under the subject of the composition of nitrogen, and the
constitution of the atmosphere. We further caution our author against
admitting hints, allusions, and inuendos as to the possibility of
future inventions and discoveries, as claims upon the merits of such
discoveries, when they are actually made. Berzelius has talked a vast
deal of nonsense about the composition of nitrogen; and should that
discovery ever be made, he will doubtlessly assume the credit of
having suggested the steps which led to it. Some foolish persons are
apt to think that the Marquis of Worcester was the inventor of Watt’s
steam-engine, because he said he had means of raising water by steam,
in his <em class="italic">Century of Inventions</em>; and we have heard that an eminent
chemist of the present day considers himself entitled to all the
merit that may belong to Mr. Brunel’s carbonic acid engine, because
he had previously stated the possibility of such an application of
Mr. Faraday’s important discoveries. The fact is, that these are
woeful days for science; all the good feeling and free communication
that used to exist among its active cultivators in this country, has
given way to petty jealousies and quibbling scandal; one person is
exalted for the purpose of depreciating another; and those causes of
disgust, which some years ago induced one of our most amiable and
able men of science to quit the field, and even leave the country,
are becoming daily more prevalent. Were it not an invidious task, we
could easily explain and unfold the sources of all this mischief, and
shall indeed feel it our duty so to do, should not matters in due
time take a more favourable turn; but the task is at once serious
and disagreeable, and we therefore postpone it, in the hope of more
favourable events. We really believe that, had it not been for the
scientific conversationes held during the last season at the houses
of a few private gentlemen connected with the learned societies,
and more especially the weekly meetings at the Royal Institution,
which kept up a friendly intercourse among those who were willing
to profit by it, that the whole scientific world would have been at
loggerheads, and in that state of anarchy of which the evils may be
learned by a short residence at a “northern seat of learning.”</p>

<p>The main object of this digression is to deprecate <em class="italic">party</em> in
science; and we were led to it by observing, or thinking that we
observe, something of such a tendency in the writer whose book is
before us—we hope we are mistaken.</p>

<p>The next section comprises “the compounds of the simple
<span class="xxpn" id="p066">[p066]</span>
non-metallic acidifiable combustibles with each other.” It includes
the important subject of ammonia, of the varieties of carburetted
hydrogen, sulphuretted and phosphuretted hydrogen, and cyanogen
and its compounds. The metals are then treated of, and to these
succeed their salts; and though the execution of this part of the
work betrays some haste, it shows also considerable reading, and
some originality: the general views are well and clearly sketched,
but there are many points upon which we are entirely at variance
with our author; and we more especially object to his account of the
action of chlorides upon water, and to his notions concerning the
“muriates of oxides,” a class of compounds of which, with one or two
exceptions, we are disinclined to admit the existence. If common
salt be a <em class="italic">chloride</em> of <em class="italic">sodium</em>, and experiment obliges us so to
regard it, what is there in its aqueous solution that should lead us
to consider it as containing a <em class="italic">muriate</em> of <em class="italic">soda</em>; what evidence of
any new arrangement of elements? Dr. T. is certainly in mistake, when
he says, “for all practical purposes, therefore, the solution of a
metallic chloride in water may be viewed as the muriate of an oxide,
and on this account I shall always regard it as such in the present
treatise.” This inconsiderate dogma taints much of the reasoning
upon the chlorides, &#38;c., and is manifestly culled in the Thomsonian
school, though we have indeed heard that a Professor at Edinburgh
thus addresses his pupils upon the above subject: “The elaborate
researches of the illustrious Davy have taught us that common salt
is a binary compound of chlorine and sodium, a chloride, therefore,
or a chloruret of sodium. But it is only chloride of sodium whilst
quiescent in the salt-cellar; for no sooner does it come into
contact with the salivary humidity of the fauces, than, by the play
of affinities, which I have elsewhere explained, the sodium becomes
soda, and the chlorine generates muriatic acid;—that, therefore,
which upon the table is chloride of sodium, is muriate of soda in
the mouth; and this again, when desiccated or deprived of humidity,
retrogrades into its former state.”</p>

<p>Dr. Turner again falls into error, as we humbly conceive, in calling
certain salts, such, for instance, as those of the peroxide of iron,
<em class="italic">sesquisalts</em>, a term properly applied in those cases only where one
proportional of a protoxide unites with one and a half of an acid,
such for instance as the <em class="italic">sesquicarbonate of soda</em>, &#38;c., but in the
sesquisulphate of iron, one proportional of the peroxide contains
1.5 of oxygen, and
<span class="xxpn" id="p067">[p067]</span>
necessarily, therefore, (according to
Berzelius’ canon, if the Doctor pleases,) requires 1.5 of acid to
convert it into a salt; just as the commonly constituted peroxides
(containing two proportionals of oxygen) require two of acid. Dr.
Thomson, with all his nomenclatural pretensions, has fallen into the
same error.</p>

<p>The part of our author’s work which treats of the chemistry of
organic bodies is, upon the whole, an unexceptionable and accurate
epitome of that complicated branch of the science. It has its
inaccuracies, but they apparently arise out of the difficulty of
condensing into the space of a few pages, matter which, as we have
elsewhere remarked, would require an ample volume for its extended
and perspicuous details.</p>

<p>In our hasty account of this work, we have rather dwelt upon its
defects than its merits, in the hope of seeing another and more
extended edition, free from what we consider as serious obstacles
to the success and usefulness of the present production. We hope
that Dr. Turner will not feel offended at the freedom with which
our remarks are offered. We are anxious that a writer of such good
information should be induced to think for himself; at least, that
he should accurately weigh the pretensions, and inquire into the
originality of those views and researches upon which he bestows such
unqualified and, in our opinion, undeserved praise, and to which he
assents with a facility unbecoming one who evidently possesses the
means of testing their merits.</p>

<em class="italic">Experiments on Audition</em>. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a>
<span class="smaller">
[Communicated by Mr. C. Wheatstone.]</span></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">T<span>HE</span></span>
recent valuable experiments of Savart<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-23" href="#fn-23">23</a> and of Dr. Wollaston
have added to our stock of information several important and
hitherto unnoticed phenomena relating audition; but, notwithstanding
the investigations of these distinguished experimentalists, and
though the physiology of the ear has been an object of unceasing
attention for many centuries, yet we are far from possessing a
perfect knowledge of the functions of the various parts of this
organ. The description of new facts illustrative of this subject
cannot, therefore, be devoid of interest;
<span class="xxpn" id="p068">[p068]</span>
and though I do not
anticipate that the observations contained in this communication will
lead to any important results, their novelty may claim for them some
attention from the readers of your Journal.</p>

<h4>§ 1.</h4>

<p>If the hand be placed so as to cover the ear, or if the entrance
of the meatus auditorius be closed by the finger without pressure,
the perception of external sounds will be considerably diminished,
but the sounds of the voice produced internally will be greatly
augmented: the pronunciation of those vowels in which the cavity of
the mouth is the most closed, as <em class="italic">e</em> <em class="italic">ou</em>, &#38;c., produce the strongest
effect; on articulating smartly the syllables <em class="italic">te</em> and <em class="italic">kew</em>, the
sound will be painfully loud.</p>

<p>Placing the conducting stem of a sounding tuning-fork<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-24" href="#fn-24">24</a> on any part
of the head, when the ears are closed as above described, a similar
augmentation of sound will be observed. When one ear remains open,
the sound will always be referred to the closed ear, but when both
ears are closed, the sound will appear louder in that ear the nearer
to which it is produced. If, therefore, the tuning-fork be applied
above the temporal bone near either ear, it will be apparently heard
by that ear to which it is adjacent; but on removing the hand from
this ear (although the fork remains in the same situation) the sound
will appear to be referred immediately to the opposite ear.</p>

<p>In the case of the vocal articulations, the augmentation is
accompanied by a reedy sound, occasioned by the strong agitations
of the tympanum. When the air in the meatus is compressed against
this membrane by pressing the hand <em class="italic">close</em> to the ear, or when
the eustachian tube is exhausted by the means indicated by Dr.
Wollaston, the reedy sound is no longer heard, and the augmentation
is considerably diminished. The ringing
<span class="xxpn" id="p069">[p069]</span>
noise which
simultaneously accompanies a very intense sound, proceeds from the
same cause, and may be prevented by the same means. This ringing may
be produced by applying the stem of a sounding tuning-fork to the
hand when covering the ear, or by whistling when a hearing trumpet
is placed to the ear. As a proof that the resulting augmentation,
which, when great, excites the vibrations of the tympanum, is owing
to the reciprocation of the vibrations by the air contained within
the closed cavity, it may be mentioned, that when the entrance of the
meatus is closed by a fibrous substance, as wool, &#38;c., no increase is
obtained.</p>

<p>If the meatus and the concha of one ear be filled with water, the
sounds above-mentioned will be referred to the cavity containing the
water in the same way as when it contained air, and was closed by
the hand; it will be indifferent whether any partition be interposed
between the cavity and the external air; as the water is equally well
insulated by a surface of air as by a solid body.</p>

<h4>§ 2.</h4>

<p>The preceding experiments have shown, that sounds immediately
communicated to the closed meatus externus are very greatly
augmented; and it is an obvious inference, that if <em class="italic">external</em> sounds
can be communicated, so as to act on the cavity in a similar manner,
they must receive a corresponding augmentation. The great intensity
with which sound is transmitted by solid rods, at the same time that
its diffusion is prevented, affords a ready means of effecting this
purpose, and of constructing an instrument, which, from its rendering
audible the weakest sounds, may with propriety be named a Microphone.</p>

<p>Procure two flat pieces of plated metal, each sufficiently large
to cover the external ear, to the form also of which they may be
adapted; on the outside of each plate directly opposite the meatus,
rivet a rod of iron or brass wire about 16 inches in length, and
one-eighth of an inch in diameter, and fasten the two rods together
at their unfixed extremities, so as to meet in a single point. The
rods must be so curved, that when the plates are applied to the
ears, each rod may at one end be perpendicularly inserted into its
corresponding plate, and at the other end may meet before the head in
the plane of the mesial
<span class="xxpn" id="p070">[p070]</span>
line. The spring of the rods will be
sufficient to fix the plates to the ears, but for greater security
ribands may be attached to each rod near its insertion in the plate,
and be tied behind the head.</p>

<div class="figc-s5">
<img src="images/i070.jpg" width="144" height="198" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A more simple instrument may be constructed to be applied to one ear
only, by inserting a straight rod perpendicularly into a similar
plate to those described above.</p>

<p>The Microphone is calculated only for hearing sounds when it is in
immediate contact with sonorous bodies; when they are diffused by
their transmission through the air, this instrument will not afford
the slightest assistance.</p>

<p>It is not my intention in this place to detail all the various
experiments which may be made with this instrument, a few will
suffice to enable the experimenter to vary them at his pleasure.</p>

<p>1. If a bell be rung in a vessel of water, and the point of the
microphone be placed in the water at different distances from the
bell, the differences of intensity will be very sensible. 2. If
the point of the microphone be applied to the sides of a vessel
containing a boiling liquid, or if it be placed in the liquid itself,
the various sounds which are rendered may be heard very distinctly.
3. The instrument affords a means of ascertaining, with considerable
accuracy, the points of a sonorous body at which the intensity of
vibration is the greatest or least; thus, placing its point on
different parts of the sounding board of a violin or guitar, whilst
one of its strings is in vibration, the points of greatest and least
vibration are easily distinguished. 4. If the stem of a sounding
tuning-fork be brought in contact with any part of the microphone,
and at the same time a musical sound be produced by the voice, the
most uninitiated ear
<span class="xxpn" id="p071">[p071]</span>
will be able to perceive the consonance
or dissonance of the two sounds; the roughness of discords, and the
beatings of imperfect consonances, are thereby rendered so extremely
disagreeable, and form so evident a contrast to the agreeable
harmony and smoothness of two perfectly consonant sounds, that it is
impossible that they can be confounded.</p>

<h4>§ 3.</h4>

<p>Apply the broad sides of two sounding tuning-forks, both being
unisons, to the same ear; on removing one fork to the opposite ear,
allowing the other to remain, the sensation will be considerably
augmented.</p>

<p>It is well known, that when two consonant sounds are heard together,
a third sound results from the coincidences of their vibrations;
and that this third sound, which is called the grave harmonic, is
always equal to unity, when the two primitive sounds are represented
by the lowest integral numbers. This being premised, select two
tuning-forks, the sounds of which differ by any consonant interval
excepting the octave; place the broad sides of their branches, while
in vibration, close to one ear, in such a manner that they shall
nearly touch at the acoustic axis, the resulting grave harmonic will
then be strongly audible, combined with the two other sounds; place
afterwards one fork to each ear, and the consonance will be heard
much richer in volume, but no audible indications whatever of the
third sound will be perceived.</p>

<h4>§ 4.</h4>

<p>Very acute sounds, such as the chirping of the gryllus campestris,
&#38;c., are rendered inaudible by exhausting the air from the Eustachian
tube, and thereby producing a tension of the membrane of the
tympanum; the different thicknesses or tensions of this membrane
may therefore occasion that diversity of the limits of audibility,
with regard to the acute sounds which Dr. Wollaston has pointed out
as existing in different individuals; if so, it would be desirable
to ascertain this limit in individuals in whom the tympanum is
perforated, or destroyed.</p>

<h4>§ 5.</h4>

<p>When the auricula is brought forward, all <em class="italic">acute</em> sounds are rendered
much more intense, but no sensible difference is
<span class="xxpn" id="p072">[p072]</span>
perceived
with regard to the grave sounds. The <em class="italic">higher</em> tones of glass
staccados, or of an octave flute, the ticking of a watch, all kinds
of sibilant sounds, &#38;c. are thus greatly augmented: the experiment
is easily tried, by whistling very shrill notes. A still greater
augmentation of the acute sounds is obtained, by placing the hands
formed into a concave behind the ears, and by bending downwards the
upper part of the auricula, so as to obtain a more complete cavity.</p>

<h4>§ 6.</h4>

<p>I will conclude with the following observation: I had, in consequence
of a cold, a very slight pain in my left ear; on sounding the regular
notes of the piano-forte, C<sup>3</sup> and C<sup>4</sup> were much louder than the
others, and the loudness was much increased, by placing the hand
in the manner above described to the left ear. When it was pressed
close, or when the Eustachian tube was closed, the intensities of
all the notes were equalized. I attribute this affection to the
diminished tension of the membrana tympani, which was again increased
by the operation described.</p>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn-24" href="#fnanchor-24">24</a> The tuning-fork consists of a four-sided metallic rod, bent so
as to form two equal and parallel branches, having a stem connected
with the lower curved part of the rod, and contained within the
plane of the two branches. The branches are caused to vibrate by
striking one end against a hard body, whilst the stem is held in the
hand. The sound produced by this instrument when insulated is very
weak, and can only be distinctly heard when its branches are brought
close to the ear; but instantly its stem is connected with any
surface capable of vibrating, a great augmentation of sound ensues
from the communicated vibrations. The facility of its insulation and
communication renders it a very convenient instrument for a variety
of acoustical experiments.</p></div>

<em class="italic">On the Petromyzon Marinus</em>. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">O<span>N</span></span>
entering the harbour of Dublin a few weeks ago, we were becalmed
off the Hill of Howth, and to pass the tedious time until a breeze
sprung up, we found some lines on board, and began to fish from the
quarter-deck. We caught a number of grey gurnet; but our attention
was particularly attracted by a pull of uncommon force on one of
the lines. Having rendered assistance to the person who held it, we
were all astonished to see rise out of the water a large fish, with
apparently a double body, which, after floundering on the surface
of the water, we pulled on deck. On examining this phenomenon for
a short time, we were again surprized to see it separate into two
parts; and then found that there were <em class="italic">two</em> large fish taken up on
the same hook, the head of one having been buried under the throat
of the other, to which it had firmly attached itself. When separated
by force, it wiggled about on the deck with extraordinary strength
and agility, and again darted on its prey, to which
<span class="xxpn" id="p073">[p073]</span>
it adhered
so firmly, that it required very considerable exertion to detach
it; for it suffered itself to be raised up by the tail, and shaken,
still holding the other fish suspended from its jaws. When finally
separated, it showed great ferocity, darting at every thing near it,
and at last seizing the deck, which it held very fast, writhing with
its tail and body as if in the act of tearing it to pieces. When
detached, its teeth left a deep circular impression on the wood, the
fibres of which were drawn into the cavity of its jaws, so as to be
raised up in the form of a cone. I now directed, that it should be
put into a bucket of sea water, in the hope of preserving it alive
until we arrived in Dublin, but it died in a shorter time than could
be expected, from the energy and activity it had displayed, long
after the other fish was dead. We had handled it very roughly, and so
perhaps had mortally hurt an animal otherwise very tenacious of life.</p>

<div class="figc-s1">
<img src="images/i073.jpg" width="600" height="586" alt="" />
</div>

<p>On examining the fishes, I found that which had taken the hook,
was the <em class="italic">gadus Polachius</em>, or whiting Pollack. It was about two
feet long, and it is probable its active enemy had fastened
<span class="xxpn" id="p074">[p074]</span>
on it after it had been hooked; if <em class="italic">before</em>, it would indicate an
extraordinary insensibility to pain in an animal that could attend to
the calls of appetite, whilst another was preying on its vitals. The
fish which had fastened on the pollack, was the <em class="italic">petromyzon marinus</em>,
or sea lamprey. It was nearly three feet long, and resembled a large
eel in shape. Its general colour was a dull brownish olive variegated
with bluish blotches; the back darker, and the belly paler, inclining
to yellow. The eyes were small, and the mouth large and oval; but
when distended, circular. The inside of the jaws was deeply concave,
and studded with circular rows of sharp triangular teeth, that issued
from corresponding orange-coloured papular protuberances, which
formed the gums; the tongue was short and crescent-shaped, furnished
with a row of very small teeth round the edge. On the top of the
head was a small orifice, or spout-hole, from whence it discharged
the superfluous water taken at the mouth. But the circumstance that
more particularly distinguished it, was that which gave rise to the
vulgar error that it had sixteen eyes. On either side of the neck,
commencing just below the real eyes, was a row of seven equidistant
spiracles exactly resembling eyes; they are, however, holes lined
with a red membrane, and all opening into the mouth, an apparatus to
supply the place of gills, whose functions are to extract oxygen from
the water, and so perform the office of lungs in aquatic animals. It
had two dorsal fins, one on the lower part of the back, narrow, with
a roundish outline; the other commencing where the first terminated.
The spine was cartilaginous, without processes. The pericardium,
containing a small heart, was a remarkably strong membrane, and the
liver was as green as grass.</p>

<p>This fish is not uncommon in the North Seas, though it most abounds
in the Mediterranean, where, from earliest times, it was esteemed a
luxurious dish. Fish-ponds were purposely constructed to preserve
it. On our coast, Pennant observes, that it is found most frequently
at the mouth of the Severn, which river it sometimes ascends, where
it is occasionally taken, firmly attached to a stone by its mouth,
while its tail and body are waving freely to the current. Its
adhesion at such times is so strong, that it may be lifted with a
stone of twelve pounds weight appended to its mouth. This faculty
is owing to its
<span class="xxpn" id="p075">[p075]</span>
power of suction; while the circumstance of
its circular jaws coming in close contact with the surface of the
body excludes the external air within the cavity of the mouth, and
so adheres like the hand placed on the cup of an air-pump. It is
from this remarkable property, that its scientific name has been
imposed<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-25" href="#fn-25">25</a>. Its vulgar name, lamprey, from lampetra, has a similar
derivation. By the Romans it was named muræna. As this fish was well
known and highly prized by the ancients, there is none that has been
so frequently described and alluded to. Aristotle, Pliny, Tacitus,
Columella, Ælian, Seneca, and Oppian, have mentioned its properties
and habits, which correspond exactly with those I have described
above. Pliny says, in the northern parts of France, and consequently
contiguous to the British Isles, the lampreys have seven spots in
the jaws, resembling the constellation of the plough, evidently the
same as the eyes, which vulgar opinion assigns to the fish<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-26" href="#fn-26">26</a>. Their
extreme voracity was such, that criminals were thrown among them to
be devoured. Seneca relates, that Vedius Pollio, a Roman knight,
ordered his servant, who had broken a crystal vase, to be thrown into
a large pond of lampreys<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-27" href="#fn-27">27</a>; and Columella writes, that they were
sometimes seized with a rabid fury, that resembled canine madness;
in the access of which, they seized upon other fish, so that it was
impossible to keep them in the same pond<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-28" href="#fn-28">28</a>; and to account for this
extraordinary ferocity, Oppian and others assert, that the lamprey
is impregnated by a serpent; the one issuing from the sea, and the
other rushing down to the rocks, inflamed with madness, to consummate
the impregnation; and adds, that the extraordinary intercourse was
effected by the lamprey seizing the serpent’s head in its
<span class="xxpn" id="p076">[p076]</span>
mouth<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-29" href="#fn-29">29</a>. This singular copulation was the reason why the Romans,
who were immoderately fond of lampreys, did not wish to eat them,
when impregnated by the supposed serpent. Horace, therefore, makes
Nasidienus, among the blunders of his supper, serve it in that
state<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-30" href="#fn-30">30</a>.</p>

<p>Lampreys were a favourite dish with our own early monarchs. Henry
<span class="allcaps">II</span>. died by eating them to excess. The celebrated Pope also owed his
death to a surfeit of them. Doctor Johnson remarks in his life of the
poet, that he was in the habit of cooking them himself in a silver
saucepan. The Corporation of Oxford still make up a periodical pye
of this fish for the king, in compliance with ancient usage. But
lampreys have lost their rank at corporation feasts, in consequence
of the more delicious and wholesome turtle being introduced into
modern cookery.</p>

<p>I have never noticed lampreys in the Dublin fish-market; and though
they are frequently used in the South of Ireland, I do not know if
they have ever been made an article of food in Dublin, or the north,
where they are rarely met with.</p>

<em class="italic">Observations upon the Motion of the Leaves of
the Mimosa Pudica</em>. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a>
<span class="smaller">
[To the Editor of the Quarterly Journal of Science.]</span></h3>

<p class="first">Dear Sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcaps">T<span>OWARDS</span></span>
the latter part of this summer, Mr. Gilbert Burnett and
myself made several experiments with a view to ascertain the nature
of the movements exhibited by the sensitive plant. We afterwards
found that the greater part of the facts which we had observed, had
been previously described by Mr. Lindsay
<span class="xxpn" id="p077">[p077]</span>
and Dr. Dutrochet.
Mr. Lindsay’s observations are to be met with in a
<span class="allcaps">MS</span>. preserved in
the library of the Royal Society, which is dated July 1790: this
essay is alluded to by Dr. Smith in his “Introduction to Botany.”
Dr. Dutrochet’s experiments were published in his “Recherches
anatomiques et physiologiques sur la Structure intime des Animaux
et des Végétaux,” which appeared in 1824. With the latter author
the reputation of originality is likely to rest: not undeservedly,
indeed, as there is no reason to suppose that <em class="italic">his</em> experiments
were suggested by a knowledge of those performed by Lindsay. It
is, however, an act of literary justice to secure to Mr. Lindsay
the credit of undoubted priority in describing the phenomena which
he noticed in common with Dutrochet. I have drawn up the following
remarks partly for this purpose—partly to have an opportunity of
mentioning some circumstances which escaped the observation of both
experimentalists.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Mimosa Pudica consist either of one or two or
three pairs of leaflets, and occasionally terminate by an odd
one. Each leaflet bears from twenty to sixty subleaflets, which
are disposed in pairs. The petiole or stalk of each leaf, at the
extremity which is attached to the branch or stem of the peant,
swells into an intumescence varying from three to five in length. A
similar intumescence, of proportionate dimensions, is seen upon each
subpetiole, where it is articulated with the petiole, and upon the
base of the stalk of each subleaflet: the intumescence is the part in
which motion takes place.</p>

<p>During the day-time the petioles are observed to have a direction
upwards, or rather to form an acute angle with the upper part of
the stem or branch, to which they are attached: the subpetioles are
divergent: the subleaflets are spread out, so as to lie nearly in one
plane. (<em class="italic">Fig.</em> 1.)</p>

<p>During the night the petioles are found to be depressed; the
subpetioles to be drawn together, the subleaflets folded, the upper
or solar surfaces of each pair being brought into contact. (<em class="italic">Fig.</em> 2.)</p>

<div class="section">
<p>The leaves rise, the leaflets diverge, and open by throwing down
their subleaflets, at daybreak: the opposite changes occur about
sunset. The experiments that are to be described, are supposed to be
performed in the day-time.

<div class="caption"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 2.</div>
</div>

<p>If a terminal subleaflet be pinched with forceps, or cut with
scissors, it rises, together with its fellow; then the next pair
rise; then the next; and so on in succession, till all the pairs of
subleaflets upon the same subpetiole are folded. In a little time
afterwards, the petiole is bent downwards at its intumescence; and in
a few seconds more the remaining leaflets upon the same petiole fold
their subleaflets in pairs, from the base towards the point of the
leaflet.</p>
</div>
<p>If a subleaflet be burnt, instead of being cut or pinched, the
phenomena above described occur more rapidly: and after they have
taken place, the adjoining leaves upon the same branch are bent down
in succession, their leaflets brought together, and their subleaflets
folded. If the plant be very vigorous and lively, an impression
<span class="xxpn" id="p079">[p079]</span>
made upon one leaf affects the rest in succession. It is well
known that the stem, branches, flowers, and roots of the sensitive
plant have no motion. But M. Desfontaines observed that, on touching
the roots with sulphuric acid, the leaves become folded; and M.
Dutrochet obtained a similar result on burning either the flower or
the stem.</p>

<div class="figc-s3">

<div class="cell33"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 5.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>If the plant be shaken, all the leaves are simultaneously thrown
down, and their leaflets folded. Mr. Lindsay attempted to elucidate
the action of the intumescence in raising and depressing the petiole,
in the following manner. He cut out a portion from the upper or solar
surface of the intumescence; after which he found that the petiole,
upon recovering, rose higher than before, (<em class="italic">Fig.</em> 3.) From another
leaf he removed the inferior portion of the intumescence: he found,
upon <em class="italic">this</em> injury, that the leaf declined more than before, and
did not again rise, (<em class="italic">Fig.</em> 4.) He noticed that a thin slice, pared
from either surface of the intumescence, has a like effect, but in
a less degree than a deep excision: and he found that when similar
experiments are made upon the intumescence of the subpetiole, there
is no essential difference in the result.</p>

<p>Thus Mr. Lindsay discovered, that the force which raises the petiole
exists in the lower part of the intumescence, and that which
depresses it, in the upper. He seems to have considered that the
temporary excess of force in either part is produced by an impulsion
of the sap from the vessels of the yielding portion into those of the
opposite portion.
<span class="xxpn" id="p080">[p080]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Dutrochet viewed these phenomena in some respects more justly. He
remarked, in addition to what Lindsay had observed, that if, instead
of the upper and under surface, the lateral part of the intumescence
be removed, the petiole becomes not raised or deflected, but inclined
towards the side on which it is injured (<em class="italic">Fig.</em> 5); and that if
longitudinal slices of the upper, or under, or lateral portions
of the intumescence are immersed in water, these separate slices
immediately become incurvated, that edge being concave which looks
towards the axis of the intumescence. From these facts Dutrochet
inferred that the texture of the intumescence possesses some
modification of irritability; that, when excited, each length of the
intumescence (to use a very imperfect expression) forcibly assumes
an incurvated figure, like a curved spring returning from a state of
temporary extension; that the petiole is raised, when the action of
the lower part of the intumescence predominates; is depressed, when
the upper portion acts with increased energy.</p>

<p>Mr. Burnett and myself had arrived at very similar conclusions
respecting the agency of the intumescence, before we became
acquainted with the inquiries of Lindsay and Dutrochet.</p>

<p>In Dutrochet’s able researches, a more exact analysis, however,
was obtained of the functions of this part. He discovered that the
cortex of the intumescence is the seat of its irritability: for upon
wholly removing the bark, so as to expose the ligneous substance, the
petiole was found to have been rendered motionless. Nevertheless,
the intumescence, thus mutilated, remains capable of transmitting an
impression made upon its leaflets to the leaves adjoining, Dutrochet
further ascertained, that the ligneous substance alone is fitted to
convey the peculiar stimulus, which spreads, from a point of the
plant that has been irritated, to the adjoining leaves.</p>

<p>The experiments already mentioned appear to explain the mode in which
the elevation and depression of the petiole, and the divergence
and approximation of the subpetioles are produced. It is probable
that the contrivance for folding and expanding the subleaflets is
of a similar nature. Mr. Burnett and myself conjectured that each
subleaflet is raised by the under part of the intumescence that
exists at its base, and
<span class="xxpn" id="p081">[p081]</span>
depressed by some action of the upper
portion of the same intumescence. In trying the soundness of this
hypothesis, we met with the following evidence in its
<span class="nowrap">favour:—</span></p>

<p>Mr. Lindsay had observed, that at the moment when the petiole is
depressed, the under part of its intumescence assumes a deeper
colour. But the under part of the intumescence of the petiole is
the portion which is shortened during its depression, and which is
overcome on this occasion by the superior force of the upper portion.</p>

<p>Now it is to be remarked that in the subleaflets the upper part
of the little intumescence belonging to each corresponds, in one
respect alluded to, with the lower portion of the intumescence of
the petiole; <em class="italic">it is the portion shortened when the leaf is folded</em>.
And we found, upon examination, that it likewise distinctly changes
colour at the moment when the subleaflet rises, while the under
surface of the intumescence of the subleaflet does not change its hue.</p>

<p>In pursuing this inquiry, another point of correspondence between
the mechanism which depresses the petiole, and that which raises the
subleaflets, was stated, which has yet additional interest.</p>

<div class="figc-s3">
<img src="images/i081.jpg" width="456" height="182" alt="" />
<div class="captable"><div class="tabrow">

<div class="cell33"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 7.</div>
<div class="cell33"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 8.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the plant is not in its most lively state, the under surface of
the intumescence of the subleaflet (<em class="italic">b</em>, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 2,) and the upper
surface of the intumescence of the petiole (<em class="italic">a</em>, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 6,) may be
pricked with a needle, without producing action. But if the opposite
surfaces, those namely, which change colour and are shortened when
the petiole is depressed and the subleaflets folded, are touched
with the point of the needle these actions are instantaneously
produced. Here the
<span class="xxpn" id="p082">[p082]</span>
subleaflet is most delicately sensible;
<em class="italic">a slight touch</em> with the point of a needle upon the upper surface
of the intumescence of the subleaflet (<em class="italic">c</em>, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 1,) causes the
single subleaflet so stimulated to rise; and in this manner all the
subleaflets upon one side of a leaflet may be raised, their fellows
remaining expanded: if the touch be something sharper, the fellow
subleaflet rises at the same time; if ruder still, the next pair of
leaflets fold directly afterwards, and the irritation then proceeds
entirely through the leaflet. But the most satisfactory and curious
results are obtained on stimulating the extension surface of the
intumescence of the petiole. The needle may be applied to every point
upon the upper or solar half of the intumescence of the petiole
(<em class="italic">a</em>, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 6,) without producing any visible effect; but if the
irritation be applied upon the under half, (<em class="italic">d</em>, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 6,) either
quite below or laterally, the petiole is immediately depressed. The
transition is abrupt from the surface against which the needle may be
made to prick, without exciting action, to one which, when the needle
reaches it, causes the petiole to be instantaneously thrown down.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that each intumescence has a surface
especially adapted to receive mechanical impressions; which surface
is placed on the side of the intumescence opposite to that, by which
the consequent motion is produced. A curious but vague analogy may be
traced between these surfaces of the sensitive plant and the organs
of sense in animals.</p>

<p>We painted with a thick layer of lamp-black in oil the intumescence
of different petioles in different ways; the upper surface of one,
the under surface of another, the side of a third. The experiment was
followed by no sensible effect. After a few minutes the petioles,
which had been thrown down by the operation, rose again in each case,
and fell again as readily as before upon being stimulated afresh.</p>

<p>We tried what result would ensue upon slitting the intumescence of
the petiole horizontally. The petiole, after this injury, did not
recover its usual direction; the intumescence appeared to have wholly
lost its properties; the leaf seemed to depress the petiole by its
weight alone, yet the leaflets expanded, and exhibited their usual
irritability, upon the depending stalk. The same effect, however, was
observed, when the
<span class="xxpn" id="p083">[p083]</span>
intumescence was divided by a longitudinal
incision, made vertically instead of horizontally.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that Dutrochet discovered that the ligneous
fibre is the channel, along which an impression is conveyed from
one part to another. Mr. Burnett and myself had made one or two
experiments upon the course which the irritation follows when
spreading from leaflet to leaflet, where several are placed upon the
same petiole.</p>

<p>If the upper third of a petiole bearing four leaflets be divided
longitudinally, the irritability of the leaflets remains for many
days unimpaired; upon cutting with scissors one subleaflet after the
plant has recovered itself, the irritation is observed to descend
the wounded leaflet, and then to pass to that adjoining upon the
same side of the petiole: afterwards the petiole falls, but there
the effect stops; it does not extend to the two other leaflets;
the direct route is cut through, and the irritation seems to find
no circuitous way, as might have been expected, perhaps through
the intumescence of the petiole back again to the leaflets, on its
summit. If on a petiole, bearing four leaflets, a lateral incision be
made, cutting the petiole half through it at a point between the two
leaflets which are situated on one side, upon irritating either of
the leaflets, between which the incision has been made, it folds its
subleaflets; then the two opposite leaflets fold <em class="italic">their</em> subleaflets;
and <em class="italic">last of all</em>, the leaflet next adjoining that first irritated,
but isolated from it by the incision, becomes folded.</p>

<p>In the few remarks which I have thus put together, I have quoted
Lindsay and Dutrochet only as far as their researches anticipated
my own: I leave unnoticed many experiments, in several of which
these authors are again found to have accidentally coincided. The
experiments to which I allude do not, however, serve to illustrate
the nature of the motion exhibited by the sensitive plant, to the
examination of which subject alone my attention was, in the present
instance, directed, in the expectation that it might throw light upon
the obscure and interesting subject of muscular action.</p>

<em class="italic">Experiments on the Nature of Labarraque’s disinfecting Soda
Liquid</em>. By M. Faraday, F.R.S., Corr. Mem. R. Acad. Sciences, Paris,
&#38;c. &#38;c. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first">1.
<span class="smcaps">T<span>HE</span></span>
following experimental investigations relate to the nature of
that medicinal preparation which M. Labarraque has lately introduced
to the world, and named <em class="italic">Chloride of oxide of Sodium</em>. They were
occasioned by the accounts which were given of this and other
substances of similar power, to the members of the Royal Institution,
at two of their Friday evening meetings<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-31" href="#fn-31">31</a>; the value of the
preparation, the uncertainty of its nature, and the inaccuracy of its
name, all urging the inquiry.</p>

<p>2. In the first instance the inquiry was directed to the nature of
the action exerted by chlorine gas upon a solution of carbonate
of soda, questions having arisen in the minds of many, whether it
was or was not identical with the action exerted by the same gas
on a solution of the caustic alkali, and whether carbonic acid was
evolved during the operation or not. Chlorine gas was therefore
carefully prepared, and after being washed was sent into a solution
of carbonate of soda, in the proportions directed by M. Labarraque;
<em class="italic">i. e.</em> 2800 grains of crystallized carbonate of soda were dissolved
in 1.28 pints of water; and being put into a Woulfe’s apparatus,
two-thirds of the chlorine evolved from a mixture of 967 grains
of salt with 750 grains of oxide of manganese, when acted upon by
967 grains of oil of vitriol, previously diluted with 750 grains
of water, were passed into it; the remaining third being partly
dissolved in the washing water, and partly retained in the open space
of the retort and washing vessel. The operation was conducted slowly,
that as little muriatic acid as possible might be carried over into
the alkali. The common air ejected from the bottle containing the
solution was collected and examined; but from the beginning to the
end of the operation not a particle of carbonic acid was disengaged
from the solution, although the chlorine was readily absorbed.
Ultimately a liquid of a very pale
<span class="xxpn" id="p085">[p085]</span>
yellow colour was obtained,
being the same as M. Labarraque’s soda liquor, and with which the
investigations were made that will hereafter be described.</p>

<p>3. An experiment was then instituted, in which the effect of excess
of chlorine, upon a solution of carbonate of soda of the same
strength as the former, was rendered evident. The solution was put
into two Woulfe’s bottles, the chlorine well washed and passed
through, until ultimately it bubbled through both portions without
absorption of any appreciable quantity. As soon as the common air
was expelled, the absorption of the chlorine was so complete in the
first bottle, that no air or gas of any kind passed into the second,
a proof that carbonic acid was not liberated in that stage of the
experiment. Continuing the introduction of the chlorine, the solution
in the first bottle gradually became yellow, the gas not being yet
visible by its colour in the atmosphere above the solution, although
chlorine could be detected there by litmus paper. Up to this time no
carbonic acid gas had been evolved; but the first alkaline solution
soon acquired a brighter colour, and now carbonic acid gas began
to separate from all parts of it, and passing over into the second
bottle, carried a little chlorine with it. The soda solution in the
first bottle still continued to absorb chlorine, whilst the evolution
of carbonic acid increased, and the colour became heightened.
After some time the evolution of carbonic acid diminished, smaller
quantities of the chlorine were absorbed by the solution, and the
rest passing into the atmosphere in the bottle, went from thence
into the second vessel, and there caused the same series of changes
and actions that had occurred in the first. The solution in the
first bottle was now of a bright chlorine yellow colour, and the gas
bubbled up through it as it would through saturated water.</p>

<p>4. When the chlorine had saturated the soda solution in the second
bottle, and an excess of gas sufficient to fill several large
jars had been passed through the whole apparatus, the latter was
dismounted, the solutions put into bottles and distinguished as
the saturated solutions of carbonated soda; they were of a bright
greenish-yellow colour, and had an insupportable odour of chlorine.</p>

<p>5. The saturated solution (4) was then examined as to the
<span class="xxpn" id="p086">[p086]</span>
change which had been occasioned by the action of the chlorine. It
bleached powerfully, and apparently contained no carbonated alkali:
but when a glass rod was dipped into it and dried in a warm current
of air, the saline matter left, when applied to moistened turmeric
paper, reddened it considerably at first, and then bleached it; and
this piece of paper being dried and afterwards moistened upon the
bleached part, gave indications of alkali to fresh turmeric paper.</p>

<p>6. A portion of the saturated solution (4) being warmed, instantly
evolved chlorine gas, then assumed a dingy appearance, and ultimately
became nearly colourless; after which it had an astringent and saline
taste. Being evaporated to dryness at a very moderate temperature, it
left a saline mass, consisting of much common salt, a considerable
quantity of chlorate of soda, and a trace of carbonate of soda. This
mixture had no bleaching powers. The dingy appearance, assumed in
the first instance, was found to be occasioned by a little manganese
which had passed over into the solutions, notwithstanding the care
taken in evolving and washing the gas.</p>

<p>7. From these experiments it was evident that when chlorine was
passed <em class="italic">in excess</em> into a solution of carbonate of soda (3), the
carbonic acid was expelled, and the soda acted upon as if it were
caustic, a mixture of chloride of sodium and chlorate of soda being
produced; with the exception of the small portion of carbonate of
soda which, it appears, may remain for some time in the solution in
contact with the excess of chlorine at common temperatures, without
undergoing this change. The quantities of chloride of sodium and
chlorate of soda were not ascertained, no doubt being entertained
that they were in the well-known proportions which occur when caustic
soda is used.</p>

<p>8. The Labarraque’s soda liquor which had been prepared as described
(2), was now examined relative to the part the chlorine played in
it, or the change the alkali had undergone, and was soon found to
be very different to that which has been described, as indeed the
experiments I had seen made by Mr. Phillips<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-32" href="#fn-32">32</a> led me to expect. The
solution had but little odour of chlorine, its taste was at first
sharp, saline, scarcely at
<span class="xxpn" id="p087">[p087]</span>
all alkaline, but with a persisting
astringent biting effect upon the tongue. When applied to turmeric
paper, it first reddened and then bleached it.</p>

<p>9. A portion of the solution (2) being boiled, gave out no chlorine;
it seemed but little changed by the operation, having the same
peculiar taste, and nearly the same bleaching power as before. This
is a sufficient proof that the chlorine, though in a state ready to
bleach or disinfect, must not be considered as in the ordinary state
of solution, either in water or a saline fluid; for ebullition will
freely carry off the chlorine under the latter circumstances.</p>

<p>10. A portion evaporated on the sandbath rather hastily, gave a dry
saline mass, quite unlike that left by the <em class="italic">saturated solution</em>
already described (6); and which, when dissolved, had the same
astringent taste as before, and bleached solution of indigo very
powerfully: when compared with an equal portion of the unevaporated
solution, which had been placed in the mean time in the dark, its
bleaching power upon diluted sulphate of indigo was 30, that of the
former being 76. Another portion, evaporated in a still more careful
manner, gave a mass of damp crystals, which, when dissolved, had the
taste, smell, and bleaching power of the original solution, with
almost equal strength.</p>

<p>11. These experiments shewed sufficiently that the whole of the
chlorine had not acted upon the carbonate of soda to produce chloride
of sodium, and chlorate of soda; that much was in a peculiar state of
solution or union which enabled it to withstand ebullition, and yet
to act freely as a bleaching or disinfecting agent; and that probably
little or none had combined with the sodium, or been converted into
chloric acid. To put these ideas to the test, two equal portions of
the Labarraque solution were taken; one was put into a large tube,
closed at one extremity, diluted sulphuric acid was added till in
excess, and then air blown through the mixture by a long small open
tube, proceeding from the mouth, for the purpose of carrying off
the chlorine; the contents of the tube were then heated nearly to
the boiling point, air being continually passed through. In this
way all the chlorine which had combined with the carbonated alkali
without decomposing it, was set free by the sulphuric acid, and
carried off by the current of air and vapour, whilst any which had
acted chemically upon the alkali would,
<span class="xxpn" id="p088">[p088]</span>
after the action of
the sulphuric acid, be contained in solution as muriatic and chloric
acids, and from the diluted state of the whole, would not be removed
by the after-process, but remain to be rendered evident by tests. The
other portion being diluted, had sulphuric acid added also in excess,
but no attempt was made to remove the chlorine. Equal quantities of
these two portions in the same state of dilution were then examined
by nitrate of silver for the quantities of chlorine sensible in them,
and it was found that the latter portion, or that which retained the
whole of the chlorine thrown into it, contained above sixty times as
much as the former.</p>

<p>12. Now although it may be supposed that in the former portion that
part of the chlorine, which, in acting energetically, had produced
chloric acid, could not be detected by the nitrate of silver, yet
more than a sixth of the small portion which remains cannot be thus
hidden; and even that quantity is diminished by the sulphuric acid
present in excess, which tends to make the chlorine in the chlorate
sensible to nitrate of silver: so that the experiment shews that
nearly 59 parts out of 60 of the chlorine in M. Labarraque’s liquid
are in a state of weak combination with the carbonated alkali, and
may be separated by acids in its original condition; that this
quantity is probably wholly available in the liquid when used as a
bleaching or disinfecting agent; that little, if any, of the chlorine
forms chloride of sodium and chlorate of soda with the alkali of
the solution; and that the portion of chlorine used in preparing
the substance which is brought into an inactive state, is almost
insensible in quantity.</p>

<p>13. The peculiar nature of this compound or solution, with the
results Mr. Phillips had shewn me (8), obtained by evaporation of a
similar preparation to dryness, induced me to try the effects of slow
evaporation, crystallization, heat, and air upon it. In the first
place five equal portions of the solution prepared by myself were
measured out: two were put into stoppered bottles, two were put into
basins and covered over with bibulous paper, and one was put into a
basin which was left open; all were set aside in an obscure place,
and remained from July 16th to August 28th. Being then examined, the
portions in the basins were found crystallized and dry; the crystals
were large and flat, striated and imperfect, resembling those formed
<span class="xxpn" id="p089">[p089]</span>
in a similar way from carbonate of soda. They were not
small and acicular, were nearly alike in the three basins, and had
effloresced only on a few minute points. A part of one portion, when
dissolved, gave a solution, having an alkaline taste, without any
of the pungency of Labarraque’s liquid; and which, when tested by
turmeric paper, reddened, but did not bleach it.</p>

<p>14. One of these portions that had effloresced least was selected,
and being dissolved, was compared in bleaching power upon diluted
sulphate of indigo, with one of the portions of solution that had
been preserved in bottles. The former had scarcely any visible
effect, though sulphuric acid was added to assist the action; a
single measure of the indigo liquor coloured the solution permanently
blue, whereas seventy-seven such measures were bleached by the
portion from the bottle. Hence the process of slow crystallization
had either almost entirely expelled the chlorine, or else had caused
it to react upon the alkali, and by entering into strong chemical
combination as chloride and chlorate, had rendered it inert as a
bleaching or disinfecting agent.</p>

<p>15. From the appearance of the crystals there was no reason to expect
the latter effect; but to put the question to the proof, one of the
evaporated portions, and one of the fluid portions contained in the
bottles, were acted upon by sulphuric acid, heat, and a current of
air, in the manner already described (11), to separate the chlorine
that had not combined as chloride or chlorate. They were then
compared with an equal portion of the solution, which retained all
its chlorine, nitrate of silver being used as before: the quantity of
chloride indicated for the latter portion was 60 parts; whilst that
of the fluid portion deprived of as much free chlorine as could be,
by sulphuric acid and blowing, was 6 parts; and for the evaporated
and crystallized portion, similarly cleared of free chlorine, only
1.5 parts.</p>

<p>16. This result, as compared with the former experiment of a similar
kind (11), shewed, that though reaction of the chlorine on the
carbonate had taken place in the evaporated portion, it was only to a
very slight extent, since the chlorine was almost as much separated
from it by the process altogether, as it had been from the recent
preparation by sulphuric acid, blowing, and heat. The experiment
shewed also that there
<span class="xxpn" id="p090">[p090]</span>
was a gradual reaction of the chlorine
and alkali in the fluid preparation, proceeding to a greater extent
than in the evaporated portion; for chlorine, equal to five parts,
was found by the nitrate of silver to remain. Hence this preparation
is one which deteriorates even in the small space of forty-three
days. Whether the effect will proceed to any great extent, prolonged
experiments only can shew.</p>

<p>17. From an experiment made upon larger quantities of the Labarraque
liquor, it would appear that the force of crystallization alone
is sufficient to exclude the chlorine. A quantity was put into an
evaporating basin, and left covered over with paper from July 16th
to August 28th. Being then examined, a few large crystals were found
covered over with a dense solution; the whole had the innocuous
odour of Labarraque’s fluid, and the fluid the usual acrid, biting
taste. The crystals being separated, one of the largest and most
perfect was chosen, and being well wiped on the exterior, and pressed
between folds of bibulous paper, was rubbed down in water, so as to
make a saturated solution. This had no astringent taste like that of
Labarraque’s fluid, or the mother-liquor, but one purely alkaline;
and when applied to turmeric paper, reddened, but did not bleach it.
Equal portions of this saturated solution and of the mother-liquor
were then compared in bleaching power, acid being added to the former
to assist the effect: it was found, notwithstanding that portions of
mother-liquor must have adhered to the crystal, that its solution had
not
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">21</span></span></span> part the power of the mother-liquor. This, in conjunction
with the other experiments, is a striking instance of the manner
in which the carbonate of soda acts, as a simple substance, with
the chlorine in the solution. The crystal itself had never been in
contact with the air: but whether it should be considered as the
excess of carbonate of soda only which crystallized; or whether it
is essential to the formation of these crystals that chlorine should
simultaneously be given off into the air; or what would take place,
if the water were abstracted without the evolution of chlorine, I
have not determined.</p>

<p>18. Notwithstanding the perfect manner in which the chlorine may be
thus separated by crystallization and slow evaporation to dryness,
yet it is certain that by quick evaporation a
<span class="xxpn" id="p091">[p091]</span>
substance
apparently quite dry may be obtained, which yet possesses strong
bleaching power. In one experiment, where, of two equal portions, one
had been evaporated in the course of twenty-four hours to dryness
upon the warm part of a sandbath, when compared with the former, it
had not lost more than one-third of its bleaching power.</p>

<p>19. With the desire of knowing what effect carbonic acid would have
on Labarraque’s fluid, and whether it possessed in a greater or
smaller degree the power of ordinary acids to expel the chlorine,
portions of the solution were put into two Woulfe’s bottles, and
a current of carbonic acid gas passed through them. The gas was
obtained from sulphuric acid and whitening in a soda-water apparatus,
and was well washed in water. The stream of gas brought away small
portions of chlorine with it, but they were not sensible to the
smell, and could only be detected by putting litmus paper into the
current. An immense quantity of gas, equal to nearly 1300 times the
volume of the fluid, was sent through; but yet very little chlorine
was removed, and the bleaching powers of the fluid were but little
diminished, though it no longer appeared alkaline to turmeric paper.
Air was then passed through the solution in large quantity; it also
removed chlorine, but apparently not quite so much as carbonic acid.</p>

<p>20. One other experiment was made upon the degree in which the
carbonate of soda in Labarraque’s liquor resisted decomposition by
the chlorine, even at high temperature. Two equal portions of the
fluid were taken, and one of them boiled rapidly for fifteen minutes;
both were then acted upon by sulphuric acid, blowing, and heat, as
described (11), and the two were then tested by nitrate of silver,
to ascertain the quantity of chlorine remaining: it was nearly
three times as much in the boiled as in the unboiled portion; and
by comparing this with the results before obtained (11), it will be
seen that, after boiling for a quarter of an hour, not more than a
twentieth part of the chlorine had acted upon the alkali, to form
chloride and chlorate.</p>

<p>21. It would seem as if I were unacquainted with Dr. Granville’s
paper upon this subject, published in the last volume of this
Journal, p. 371, were I to close my remarks without taking
<span class="xxpn" id="p092">[p092]</span>
any notice of it. Unfortunately, Dr. Granville has mistaken M.
Labarraque’s direction, and by passing chlorine, to “complete
saturation,” through the carbonate, instead of using the quantities
directed, has failed in obtaining Labarraque’s really curious and
very important liquid; to which, in consequence, not one of his
observations or experiments applies, although the latter are quite
correct in themselves.</p>

<a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first">My dear Sir,</p>

<p>I
<span class="smmaj">AM</span> happy to tell you that our prospects of new documents from Egypt
are very rapidly increasing: Mr.
<span class="smcaps">B<span>URTON</span></span> has had the good fortune to
discover at length, in a mosque, the triple inscription for which he
has been some years in search; and he has been negotiating with the
Pacha for its removal. From its magnitude and state of preservation,
there is every reason to believe that it will rival the pillar of
Rosetta in its importance, and I sincerely hope that it will tend
to check the wildness of conjecture, which has been rioting without
bounds in the regions of Egyptian literature. Mr. Tattam is printing
a Coptic grammar, and I am preparing an Appendix, which is to contain
the rudiments of an Enchorial Lexicon: I ardently wish that Mr.
Burton’s inscriptions may come to my assistance before I complete
it. I have received nothing from France or from Germany for these
four years past: even what is published seems by some fatality to
have been withheld from me; and the booksellers send no answers to my
commissions. I trust your brother will not forget his kind promise to
think of me at Berlin.</p>

<p>I have to thank him and you for your obliging present of your <em class="italic">Letter
to Abel Remusat on the Genius of the Chinese Language</em>, which has
greatly interested me: the best return that I can make will be to
give you some remarks which have occurred to me on the language of
hieroglyphics in general,
<span class="xxpn" id="p093">[p093]</span>
and on the character of the English
language, which seems to approach, in its simplicity, as you have
yourself observed, to the natural structure of the oldest languages,
immediately related to the hieroglyphical form of representation. I
fear, however, that I must apologize to you for the want of method
with which I shall be obliged at present to throw my fragments
together: but it may be allowable to make some difference between a
letter and a finished essay.</p>

<p>Hieroglyphics, in their primitive form, are scarcely to be considered
in any case as simply a mode of expressing an oral language: they
may be a direct and independent representation of our thoughts, that
is, of recollections, or sentiments, or intentions, collateral to
the representation of the same thoughts by the language of sounds.
We find, in many of the Egyptian monuments, a double expression
of the same sense: first, a simple picture, for instance, of a
votary presenting a vase to a sitting deity; each characterized by
some peculiarity of form, and each distinguished also by a name
written over him; and this may be called a pure hieroglyphical
representation, though it scarcely amounts to a language, any more
than the look of love is a language of a lover. But we universally
find that the tablet is accompanied by a greater variety of
characters which certainly do constitute a language, although we know
little or nothing of the sounds of that language; but its import is,
that “such a king offers a vase to the deity;” and on the other side,
that “the deity grants to the king health and strength, and beauty
and riches, and dominion and power.” It is common to see, in these
inscriptions, a number of characters introduced, which are evidently
identical with some of those in the tablets: and however some of
them may occasionally have been employed phonetically, there can
be no question of the nature of the changes which their employment
must have gone through before they assumed the character of sounds:
but this is altogether a separate consideration, and foreign to the
present purpose.</p>

<p>Now it is obvious that objects, delineated with the intention of
representing the originals to the eye by their form, must necessarily
be nouns substantive; and that the picture, containing no verb
whatever, can scarcely be said to constitute
<span class="xxpn" id="p094">[p094]</span>
either a positive
or a negative assertion. At the same time, it must be allowed that
a picture of King George the Fourth’s coronation, with the date 19
July 1821, could scarcely be considered otherwise than as asserting
a historical truth; and if any emblem of Truth were attached to it,
or if it were deposited among the records of other historical facts,
it would be equivalent to the expression, “George
<span class="allcaps">IV</span>. crowned in July
1821,” which <em class="italic">scarcely</em> wants the verb <em class="italic">was</em> to convert it into a
positive assertion of a fact.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, however, there seems to be no direct mode of
supplying the want of the verb <em class="italic">is</em> or <em class="italic">was</em> in pure hieroglyphical
writing; and if any such sign was employed in the Egyptian or the
old Chinese hieroglyphics, its introduction must have been arbitrary
or conventional; like the employment of a postulate in mathematics.
Every other part of a language appears capable of being reduced,
with more or less circumlocution, to the form of a noun substantive;
and the English language appears to approach to the Chinese in the
facility with which all the forms of grammar may be shaken off.</p>

<p>There is, however, often occasion, in such cases, for a certain
degree of metaphor approaching to poetical latitude; and hence it
may happen that the least literary nations are sometimes the most
poetical. It is, in fact, impossible to exclude metaphor altogether
from the most prosaic language; and it is frequently difficult to say
where metaphor ends and strict logical prose begins; but by degrees
the metaphor drops, and the simple figurative sense is retained. Thus
we may say <em class="italic">liquid ruby</em> with the same exact meaning as <em class="italic">crimson
wine</em>; and yet <em class="italic">ruby</em> would never be called an adjective, though
employed merely to express the colour: in <em class="italic">coral lips</em>, however, the
<em class="italic">coral</em>, first used metaphorically, is converted by habit into an
adjective, and the expression is considered as synonymous with <em class="italic">labri
corallini</em>.</p>

<p>The general custom in English is to place the figurative substantive,
used as an adjective by comparison, or by abstraction, before the
name which retains its proper sense: thus a chestnut horse is a
chestnut like or chestnut coloured horse; a horse chestnut is a
coarse kind of chestnut: and in this manner we are enabled to
use almost every English noun substantive as an adjective, by an
ellipsis of the word <em class="italic">like</em>, which,
<span class="xxpn" id="p095">[p095]</span>
if inserted entire or
abridged, would make a real adjective of the word, as war<em class="italic">like</em>,
friend<em class="italic">ly</em>. But this omission of the termination, like other figures
of speech, is easily forgotten in the ordinary forms of language;
and the Germans, as well as the English, make use of almost all
their substantives in the place of adjectives, though they are
more in the habit of continuing them into single long words. When,
however, the substantives are so used, they generally become by
abstraction real adjectives: for we seldom think of a <em class="italic">chestnut</em>,
in speaking of the colour of a horse; but the idea of a light brown
coat, with an ugly pale-red mane and tail, and a fidgety temper, is
very likely to occur to us: and in a horse chestnut the idea of a
horse is out of the question; we only think of a coarse fruit which
a man cannot eat: so that the true sense, in both these instances,
is that of a quality; but <em class="italic">coral lips</em> and <em class="italic">ivory hands</em> are rather
elliptical expressions, composed of two substantives, which might
fairly be represented hieroglyphically by the assistance of a branch
of coral and an elephant’s tusk. But to describe an abstract quality
by any hieroglyphic character, representative of form only, would
be generally impossible: colours might be imitated, if we supposed
coloured figures to be employed; but other simple ideas, such as
those of sound or touch, could never be immediately presented to the
eye; and some circuitous invention would always be required for their
representation.</p>

<p>Horne Tooke has shewn, with considerable felicity of
illustration, that all the parts of speech may be resolved into
the noun and the verb; but he has not pointed out so clearly
that every verb may be resolved into a noun and the single
primitive verb is or was, which, in this sense, may be said to
be the only essential verb in any language; as we find, indeed,
in the Coptic, that almost every noun becomes a verb, either by
the addition of
<span class="smmaj">PE</span>, or sometimes
even without it. Thus, <em class="italic">the morning</em>
<span class="smmaj">BLUSHES</span> is synonymous with <em
class="italic">the morning</em>
<span class="smmaj">IS</span> <em
class="italic">red</em>; <em class="italic">he loves justice</em>,
with <em class="italic">he</em>
<span class="smmaj">IS</span> <em
class="italic">a lover of justice</em>; and <em class="italic">I</em>
<span class="smmaj">AM</span> <em class="italic">an Englishman</em>,
with <em class="italic">the person now speaking</em> <span
class="smmaj">IS</span> <em class="italic">an Englishman</em>. But
this must be understood of is, was, or will be, in all its tenses;
the idea of time, if expressed, being an essential part of the verbal
sense.</p>

<p>I confess that some of these reflections have occurred to me in
looking over a very singular work, which I had the curiosity
<span class="xxpn" id="p096">[p096]</span>
to take up, in order to see what kind of information could be
possessed by a person notoriously and professedly ignorant of the
origin and relations of the language which he attempts to teach;
and, in short, what kind of light could be diffused by an apostle
of darkness. Blunders, and some of them ridiculous enough, must, of
course, be found in the works of such a person, but most of them are
such as every schoolboy might correct; and there really is so much of
sagacity in some of Mr. Cobbett’s remarks on the errors of others,
that they well deserve the attention of such as are ambitious to
write or speak with perfect accuracy.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to enter into a regular criticism of this
<em class="italic">Grammar</em>; I shall merely make a few miscellaneous observations, as
they have occurred to me in reading it, several of which would be
equally applicable to the best of the existing works of a similar
nature.</p>

<p>In Letter <span class="allcaps">III</span> we are told that <em class="italic">long</em> and <em class="italic">short</em>, though adjectives,
do not express <em class="italic">qualities</em>, but merely dimension or duration; from a
singular misconception of the proper sense of the word <em class="italic">quality</em>. We
find, in Letter <span class="allcaps">IV</span>, the rule given by most grammarians, though not by
all, that the article A becomes <span class="allcaps">AN</span>, when it is followed by any word
beginning with a vowel; but it is surely more natural to follow the
sound than the spelling, and, as we should never think of saying an
<em class="italic">youthful</em> bride, it seems equally incorrect to say an <em class="italic">useful</em> piece
of furniture; for the initial sound is precisely the same. In the
same manner
<span class="smmaj">A</span> <em class="italic">unit</em> and
<span class="smmaj">A</span> <em class="italic">European</em>, seems to sound more agreeable
than
<span class="smmaj">AN</span>; and the best speakers appear to adopt this custom.</p>

<p>Letter <span class="allcaps">VIII</span> gives us a rule for doubling the last letter of a verb in
the participle if an accent is on the last syllable: but it should
be observed that the L is doubled, whether accented or not, as in
<em class="italic">caballing</em>, <em class="italic">travelled</em>, <em class="italic">levelled</em>, <em class="italic">cavilled</em>, <em class="italic">controlled</em>. The
same letter contains a “List of verbs, which, by some persons, are
erroneously deemed irregular,” and which have been so deemed from the
time of our German and Saxon ancestors, though Mr. Cobbett thinks
it would be more philosophical to conjugate them regularly. Thus
we may see at once that <em class="italic">freeze</em> may as well give us <em class="italic">frozen</em>, as
<em class="italic">frieren</em> gives the Germans <em class="italic">gefroren</em>; that <em class="italic">hang</em> may make <em class="italic">hung</em>
or <em class="italic">hanged</em>, according
<span class="xxpn" id="p097">[p097]</span>
to its sense, as in German we have
<em class="italic">hienge</em> from <em class="italic">hangen</em>, and <em class="italic">hängte</em> from <em class="italic">hängen</em>, to execute. For
<em class="italic">sling</em> and <em class="italic">slung</em>, we have authority in <em class="italic">schlingen</em>, <em class="italic">geschlungen</em>,
for <em class="italic">spring</em> and <em class="italic">sprung</em> in <em class="italic">springen</em> and <em class="italic">gesprungen</em>; for
<em class="italic">swollen</em>, <em class="italic">swam</em> or <em class="italic">swum</em>, and <em class="italic">swung</em>, in <em class="italic">geschwollen</em>,
<em class="italic">geschwommen</em>, and <em class="italic">geschwungen</em>. And it is quite clear from these
examples that “the bad practice of abbreviating, or shortening,” has
nothing to do with the matter.</p>

<p>In Letter <span class="allcaps">XIV</span> we have a very distinct examination of a rule in
punctuation which has been commonly adopted by good printers, without
so distinct a description of its foundation. “Commas are made use of
when phrases, that is to say ‘portions’ of words, are ‘throw<em class="italic">ed</em>’
into a sentence, and which are not absolutely necessary to assist in
its grammatical construction.” In a word, two commas are very nearly
equivalent to the old fashioned parenthesis. Again, “the apostrophe
ought to be called the mark not of elision, but of <em class="italic">laziness</em> and
<em class="italic">vulgarity</em>;” a remark made in truly classical taste, which might
have been extended with perfect propriety to the subject of the
next paragraph, the <em class="italic">Hyphen</em>, the insertion of which is, to make it
uncertain whether the words united by it are one word or two. He
goes on admirably in the next page. “<em class="italic">Notes</em>, like parentheses, are
<em class="italic">interrupters</em>, and much more troublesome interrupters, because they
generally tell a much longer story. The employing of them arises,
in almost all cases, from confusion in the mind of the writer. He
finds the matter <em class="italic">too much for him</em>. He has not the talent to work
it all up into one lucid whole; and, therefore, he puts part of it
into <em class="italic">Notes</em>”&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. “Instead of the word <em class="italic">and</em>, you often see
people put <em class="italic">&#38;</em>. For what reason I should like to know. But to this
<em class="italic">&#38;</em> is sometimes added a <em class="italic">c</em>; thus, <em class="italic">&#38;c.</em> <em class="italic">And</em> is, in Latin, <em class="italic">et</em>,
and <em class="italic">c</em> is the first letter of the Latin word <em class="italic">caetera</em>, which means
the like, or <em class="italic">so on</em>. This abbreviation of a foreign word is a most
convenient thing for such writers as have too much indolence or
too little sense to say fully and clearly what they ought to say.
If you <em class="italic">mean</em> to say <em class="italic">and the like</em>, or, <em class="italic">and so on</em>, why not say
it?&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. The abbreviation is very frequently made use of <em class="italic">without
the writer having</em> any idea of its import.” But it is surely a
mischievous maxim, never to “think of <em class="italic">mending</em> what you write. Let
it <em class="italic">go</em>. No
<span class="xxpn" id="p098">[p098]</span>
patching; no <em class="italic">after painting</em>.” On the other
hand he is right in protesting “against the use of what, by some,
is called the <em class="italic">dash</em>. Who is to know what is intended by the use of
these <em class="italic">dashes</em>?&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. It is a cover for ignorance as to the use of
points; and it can answer no other purpose.”</p>

<p>In Letter <span class="allcaps">XV</span>, there is a singular conceit with regard to the keeping
up a distinction between <em class="italic">a</em> and <em class="italic">an</em>, where it is insisted that we
must not say “<em class="italic">a</em> dog, cat, owl, and sparrow,” because owl requires
<em class="italic">an</em>; “and that it should be, a dog, a cat, an owl, and a sparrow;”
which is certainly better, and would be so, even if there were no owl
in the question.</p>

<p>Letter <span class="allcaps">XVII</span>. The criticism on Milton’s “than <em class="italic">whom</em> none higher sat,”
is perfectly correct. <em class="italic">Than</em> is never a preposition, and is simply a
variation from the older <em class="italic">then</em>, both in English and in German. <em class="italic">John
is better than James</em> means simply John is good first, then James:
<em class="italic">er</em> is <em class="italic">eher</em> or <em class="italic">e’er</em>. <em class="italic">Who</em> would sound awkwardly, but would be
more grammatical.</p>

<p>Letter <span class="allcaps">XIX</span> gives a definition of the ellipsis, which would be a
lesson to Apollonius himself: the compasses, it seems, “do not take
their sweep all round, but leave out parts of the area or surface.”
The objection to Blackstone’s language is very questionable. “The
very <em class="italic">scheme and model</em>
<span class="smmaj">WAS</span> settled,” may, perhaps, be defended,
because scheme and model are considered as one thing, the words being
intended to illustrate each other, but not to point out different
attributes of the administration of justice; and both words may
be admitted, as a collective term, to govern a singular rather
than a plural verb. It seems also to be an error to make <em class="italic">with</em> a
conjunction rather than a preposition, and to say “The bag, with the
guineas and dollars in it <em class="italic">were</em> stolen,” or “zeal, with discretion,
<em class="italic">do</em> much.” “I expected to have seen,” is justly noticed as a common
error for “I expected to see.” The meaning of an <em class="italic">active</em> verb is
erroneously confounded with that of a <em class="italic">transitive</em> verb, in the
remarks on the word <em class="italic">elope</em>, which means to go off, or to run off,
and we should naturally say <em class="italic">was</em> gone off, but <em class="italic">had</em> run off.</p>

<p>The nature of the subjunctive mood is dismissed in the same Letter
without better success than has been obtained by former grammarians.
An essay was published about thirty years ago in a periodical work,
which brings the subject into a small compass;
<span class="xxpn" id="p099">[p099]</span>
suggesting that
the subjunctive mood ought always to be considered as a <em class="italic">conditional
future</em>. The examples given are, “If the Elbe <em class="italic">is now</em> open, we shall
soon have the mails, and <em class="italic">then</em>, if there <em class="italic">be</em> any news from the
army, I will send it you immediately.” “If Catiline <em class="italic">was</em> generous,
it was in order to serve his ambition.” The subjunctive past, if I
<em class="italic">were</em>, becomes present, by being the future of the past; going back
to the time when the present was future, and therefore contingent;
and this conditional sense involves no difficulty, except when a
mistaken adherence to the fancied rules of grammar forces it in where
it has no business: thus the rules of some grammarians would lead
us to say, if Catiline <em class="italic">were</em> ambitious; which is totally contrary
to the true sense of the subjunctive. Mr. Cobbett seems to have
some such distinctions in view when he says that “<em class="italic">if</em> has nothing
at all to do with the government of the verb. It is the sense which
governs.” By this he means that <em class="italic">if</em> does not require a subjunctive
unless is relates to a <em class="italic">future contingency</em>. He is right in saying
“Though her chastity <em class="italic">is</em> becoming, it gives her no claim to praise”:
but most decidedly wrong in adding “she would be criminal if she
<em class="italic">was</em> not chaste”; for <em class="italic">was</em> is here used as relating to the present
circumstances, which are the future of the past, and therefore
require the subjunctive <em class="italic">were</em> to denote the condition intended. He
has, however, done signal justice to the cause of this injured verb,
by introducing it for <em class="italic">was</em>, in his sixth lesson, where he says it
should have been “Your Lordship <em class="italic">were</em> apprized of every important
circumstance.”</p>

<p>Such errors as this, however, are easily corrected, and many of
the acute remarks which have been here copied are well worthy the
attention of practical grammarians; at the same time enough has been
said, without any disparagement of Cobbett’s talents, to show that
a man cannot be well qualified to teach that which he has not had
the means of properly learning. For although the English language
appears at first sight to be extremely simple and philosophical
in its structure, it has, in fact, been derived from a variety of
heterogeneous sources; it has undergone a variety of vicissitudes,
and has served for the expression of a multiplicity of discussions
on the most refined subjects in literature and history and science,
for
<span class="xxpn" id="p100">[p100]</span>
the feelings of oratory, and the passions of poetry, and
it has been worn away by degrees, as the crystal in the stream is
worn to a pebble, till it has returned to a simplicity which wears
the aspect of the immediate offspring of the Chinese or Egyptian or
Mexican Hieroglyphics. But with all this, it has still some spots,
some idioms, which invariable custom obliges us to retain; and
which can only be distinguished from corruptions and vulgarisms by
tracing their history through the different stages of its progress,
including, of necessity, the corresponding idioms in the parent
languages out of which it has arisen.</p>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">T<span>HOUGH</span></span>
we have given a place in our Journal to two articles on
Malaria from Dr. Mac Culloch, we have thought it expedient to take
some notice of his book under the form of a review; particularly
as some matters have come under our cognizance, which may add some
illustrations to this subject where the author appears to have been
in a state of deficient information, or to have shunned the question
for reasons which appear to us somewhat over refined.</p>

<p>We allude principally here to the localities and the facts, as they
are now before us; circumstances and events which seem to us of the
greatest importance, as enforcing the value of the details which he
has collected, and as holding out warnings to the people respecting
the preservation of their healths, in addition to those which the
work before us has given in describing the soils or characters of
ground in England from which this destructive poison is generated.
And before we proceed to the analysis of his book, we shall state
what those are, or at least a few of them, while wondering that he
should have overlooked them, or regretting that any fancies should
have prevented him from stating what would have been of so much
utility.
<span class="xxpn" id="p101">[p101]</span></p>

<p>It is notorious that, in the last autumn, the remittent fevers in
various parts of the country amounted to a species of pestilence,
such as has scarcely been known in England from this cause, or we
might almost indeed say, from any other disease since the days of
Sydenham. Wherever ague had ever existed, or even been supposed
possible, in those places was this fever found: so that in all the
well-known tracts in Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent, Essex,
Sussex, Hampshire, and so forth, there was scarcely a house without
one or more inhabitants under fever, while the event, as might be
suspected, was a considerable mortality. In the parish of Marston,
in Lincolnshire, for example, it amounted to 25 in 300 inhabitants;
in some other places, it reached one in sixteen, one in thirteen,
one in nine. And so extensive was its range, that even Hastings did
not escape; while it should be almost superfluous to say that every
other town on the sea-coast was so much infested by it, that they
who resorted to them for bathing, as usual, found themselves most
awkwardly situated, and also suffered in considerable numbers.</p>

<p>To come nearer home, and to what must interest us of the metropolis
more, the same fevers were extremely abundant in various parts of
the outskirts of London, as also in the villages or towns which are
connected with it, within a range of from six to ten miles. Not
to enumerate all these, this was the case throughout the range of
streets or houses which extends from Buckingham Gate to Chelsea; in
which long line, it is said, that almost every house had a patient
or more under this fever; though, as the author has truly observed,
these were mistaken for typhus, or at least thus misnamed. Thus it
was also about Vauxhall and Lambeth; and to a great extent among
all that scattered mixture of town and country which follows from
Whitechapel, from Bishopsgate, and so forth, and very particularly
along Ratcliffe Highway, and so on, to an indefinite range along
the river, not only on this side but on the opposite one, so as
to include Rotherhithe, and then proceeding onward to Deptford,
Greenwich, Woolwich, Plumstead, so as to carry us beyond the boundary
which we proposed to notice.</p>

<p>And in addition to the towns or villages which we have just named,
we may enumerate Lewisham, in which we knew one house in which there
were nine patients under this fever, which proved mortal to one.
Dulwich, especially subject to this disorder, Fulham, Ealing, and the
several other villages along the Thames, as far as Chertsey; and even
Richmond,
<span class="xxpn" id="p102">[p102]</span>
where, as at Lewisham, there was one house known to
us, inasmuch as being intimate friends, where ten individuals at one
time were suffering under this disease.</p>

<p>We must not prolong this enumeration, since we might easily occupy
a dozen of our pages with similar details, ranging, in fact, all
over England; but we must still observe, that whatever was the
pestilence last year, it promises to be much greater in the present
one. This is easily judged from the manner in which the season has
set in; but still more decidedly from the extraordinary prevalence
of ague in the spring; since that which is intermittent fever then,
will be remittent in the autumn, or rather, as the author has
justly remarked, there will scarcely be a definite season of vernal
intermittent, but the remittent will commence immediately, increasing
in extent and severity as the summer advances, and promising to
become, in the autumn, the greatest season of disease that England
has known for this century.</p>

<p>As an example of this, it must suffice to enumerate two or three
facts, while these are as satisfactory for our purpose as a thousand
would be. The most general of these is, that ague is at this moment
extremely abundant where it was formerly so little known as not to
be noticed, and that where single cases used to occur, there are now
hundreds. Thus has it prevailed at Fulham and Ealing, and in the
outskirts of London, and even in the town itself; and thus does it so
prevail at Greenwich, Deptford, and in the associated vicinity, that
a medical friend informs us, that it comprises more than two-thirds
of his entire practice, which is very extensive; whereas a few years
ago he had rarely a patient in a year. Thus also in the Military
Hospital at Woolwich, there were in the spring three hundred patients
with this disease; while in former times, we are assured, that an
ague was scarcely known once in five or six years.</p>

<p>These are a few of the facts within our knowledge, but not one in
a thousand, which evince the necessity of the publication before
us; a book which seems to have been singularly well-timed, in as
far as its purpose is, by a dissection of the sources of malaria,
to diminish the ravages of both these kinds of fevers. And in this
view we consider it a work of very considerable utility, inasmuch as
it points out all the needful circumstances, as to prevention, in
great detail; while these seemed particularly called for in England,
from the entire and not less singular neglect which this subject has
experienced, not only from the people at large, but from the medical
profession. Beyond this, all that we need say of
<span class="xxpn" id="p103">[p103]</span>
the character
of the work is, that it contains the only regular and complete
attempt at the natural history of Malaria that has been executed;
since the several foreign writings on this subject are partial, or
imperfect, or local in their investigations; and having said thus
much, we shall proceed to give a brief analysis of its form and
matter. And this analysis may be truly brief, without inconvenience;
since the two Essays from the pen of the author, to which we have
given a place in our Journal, will supersede the necessity of making
that useful and practical abstract which we should otherwise have
felt ourselves bound to give.</p>

<p>To pass over an introductory chapter of the usual necessity, the
author commences by pointing out the several disorders, in a general
way, which are produced by malaria, for the purpose of proving the
sources of this poison; and as we are of those who take the facts as
already proved, we need not notice it further.</p>

<p>The third chapter details the characters of those soils or situations
which are most commonly or generally admitted to produce this poison:
and though it contains some facts not very universally known, we
shall also pass it over as of less moment than that which follows.</p>

<p>This is the fourth chapter, containing the details of the
circumstances producing malaria, which have been either denied or
overlooked; and it is one of the most important practical chapters in
the book, inasmuch as it is to the popular ignorance of these that
we must attribute a large proportion of the cases of fever occurring
in common life. These, therefore, we shall mark briefly; and even
the briefest notice will be of use in the way of precaution, while
we must refer to the book itself for those proofs of the truth of
the several views, which we could not take room to give. Generally,
however, we may state this leading argument of the author, because it
is brief, and, to us, appears satisfactory. It is this: that as the
quantity of the poison which any person can inspire is necessarily
small, and as this small quantity can be produced by a small marshy
spot as well as a large one, it is the same as to the production
of disease, whether the marsh is a foot square or a mile, provided
the exposure be complete: while also, any piece of ground where
vegetables decompose under the action of water, is virtually a marsh,
or must produce malaria.</p>

<p>This enumeration, therefore, under that view, comprises, in addition
to marshes, whether fresh or salt, all the cases where water is
present in such a manner as to act upon vegetables; and the chief are
the following.
<span class="xxpn" id="p104">[p104]</span></p>

<p>It is shown, and by facts, that the rushy swamps of high moorlands,
however small the extent, do produce this disease; and we must not
here forget to name what, however, belongs to the preceding chapter,
woods and coppices, little suspected in England, yet shown to be
the cause of fevers in Wales, and also in Sussex; very probably,
every where else. It is also shown that meadows and moist pastures,
whether in flat lands or on elevations, generate fevers; and very
particularly, should they have been affected by inundation or unusual
moisture, and if that should be followed by heat. And while it is
also specifically shown how, in all cases, it is the produce of
the drains or ditches required in meadow lands, it is distinctly
proved that, even without these, malaria is produced, or that it is
generated by the meadow or moist pasture itself.</p>

<p>It is also shown that this poison is produced by rivers, by all
flat rivers at least, or those of which the progress is slow and
through meadow lands; while this is pointed out as one of the causes,
especially, which is not suspected or not believed in England. And
here we can add a fact to our author’s statement, which is decisive:
this is the case of the barracks at Morne Bruce, in Dominica,
situated on a steep and rocky hill, perfectly dry, and free from
all other causes of suspicion, while eternally subject to the most
severe fevers. And the cause is, a mountain stream, about 300 yards
below this building, in the valley, always covered by a mist in the
evenings, and ascertained, by direct experience, to be the very cause
of the diseases in question.</p>

<p>Our author also notices canals, mill-ponds, ornamental waters, and
all other pools and ponds, even to so small a dimension as those
formed in gravel-pits; pointing out those, in particular, as common
causes of fever about London, and apparently much inclined to pass
a very severe judgment on the canal in St. James’s Park, and also
on the pond in St. James’s Square, while apparently restrained by
his prudential reasons, which appear to us sufficiently misplaced,
or, as we should fairly call them, somewhat absurd. But as we must
not affront a writer whose papers we have admitted, we shall say no
more on this matter. In noticing drains, he also speaks of moats and
modern fortifications; attempting to show that the fevers so common
in the sieges of ancient castles were produced by their moats, and
noticing the familiar fact of the frequency of fevers in fortified
towns. Lakes also are pointed out as situations generating this
poison: and it is here especially noticed that if, in those and other
cases, malaria is produced by the vegetable growth and decomposition,
<span class="xxpn" id="p105">[p105]</span>
so is it the consequence of the exposure of the mud of such
receptacles of water; a cause which is again treated of at greater
length in the subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>This chapter relates to what the author calls obscure and disputed
cases. We shall pass over these, which, as not implying precautionary
measures, are of the least interest, and commence by noticing the
case of vegetable putrefaction. It is attempted to show, that the
vegetable need not be living to produce malaria, but that, even if
utterly decomposed, its elements, acting on water, can generate this
poison. Among the cases under this head, are flax and hemp ponds,
common sewers and drains, dunghills, and tide harbours; and the
evidences under each are sufficient to make good the assertion. But
the most important of all, in our view at least, is bilge-water:
since our author has pretty clearly shown that all the fevers of
ships (excepting, of course, a few casual instances of contagion)
arise from this cause, and that if ships were kept clean, fever or
sickness would be nearly unknown at sea. This we do indeed conceive
one of the most important points in the work before us; and if the
author has referred to Sir Henry Baynton, as a stranger, we can quote
him, as a friend, that warrants for all that is here asserted, and
for far more; since his collection of facts on this subject is most
important, and we think him almost culpable in not having long ago
given them to the public. If the Leviathan was always the healthiest
ship in the navy; if she even left the West Indies, after a long
anchorage and service, with a crew of 500 men, and not one sick, it
is a case in the navy which never occurred before, nor since, and
which arose entirely from the knowledge of this able and careful
officer respecting the subject that we are discussing.</p>

<p>A sixth chapter explains, under the head of revolutions in the
production of malaria, a variety of circumstances not easily
admitting of abridgment. The chief of these are, the effects produced
by drainages, and reversely, those which arise from inundations or
other incidental causes affecting the state of the soil. But the most
important view which it contains is that which relates to the effect
of embankment in rivers, and to the geological changes produced by
the distribution of alluvia. As, however, we cannot well state this
in a small space, we shall pass to the chapter on the Propagation of
Malaria.</p>

<p>This is the largest, and, as it strikes us, the most interesting
of the whole; while the author has made it the depository of a
variety of remarks and recommendations on this
<span class="xxpn" id="p106">[p106]</span>
subject, very
particularly as it relates to the army. If he is correct,—and we
see no reason to doubt it, from the nature of the statements,—the
ignorance of this subject, even among the medical department of the
army, has been most extraordinary and most unaccountable; while if
Walcheren is proof enough of this, the writer before us has pointed
out facts enough to show that it was not a solitary case, while
evidently restrained by fear of some sort—we are almost inclined to
call it cowardice—from telling all that he might have told. And we
do think it wrong to retain or suppress that which is important to
the public safety, under a fear that the feelings of individuals may
be hurt; since the business of a writer is with justice and utility,
and the security or welfare of thousands is of infinitely greater
moment than the comforts of a few, and those also culpable.</p>

<p>Under this head, propagation, the author describes how this poison
is conveyed by the winds, while the facts add much to the number
and variety of the precautionary measures. And here also we find
a speculation of no small curiosity, respecting the East wind,
attempting to prove that wherever this is insalubrious or pernicious,
it arises from its being the vehicle of malaria; while attempting
also to prove that this substance can be conveyed from Holland to
the coasts of England in that wind. We shall not pretend to give an
opinion on this subject; and since the author himself has noticed
it in the paper printed in our present number, we shall suffer our
readers to form their own judgments respecting it.</p>

<p>One also of the most curious facts mentioned in this chapter, is the
singular limitation of malaria; and we must admit that the instance
quoted as to the Chatham road is so remarkable as to be almost
incredible; though, as we find that all the people agree in it, we
cannot pretend to say it is not a fact. Indeed the facts of this
nature, so familiar at Rome, are fully as inexplicable; so that all
we can conclude is, that we are ignorant of the philosophy of this
subject: no very great cause of surprise, unless it were proved that
we could explain every thing else which belongs to meteorology.</p>

<p>In the eighth chapter we have an explanation of the effects of
climate and seasons in the production of malaria; and while we
need not analyse the facts which it contains, we may introduce in
lieu of this, the explanations which its statements afford as to
that recent increase of the diseases of malaria which we noticed
at the commencement of this article. The last few years have been
distinguished for an
<span class="xxpn" id="p107">[p107]</span>
uncommon prevalence of East winds, and
to such a degree indeed, that we can find no meteorological records
at all to be compared with the history of these years. And while the
history of the intermittent and remittent, in London at least, from
the time of Morton and Sydenham downwards, shows that all its periods
of such diseases have been periods of East winds, it is not difficult
to see how it acts as to both classes of marsh fever. To London,
in particular, it is the best conductor, propagating the malaria
from all the moist lands to the eastward. To the East coast, if our
author’s theory is valid, it brings the malaria from Holland; and,
moreover, as it forms our hottest summers, it causes our own climate
to approximate more to the southern ones, and thus enables our lands
to produce a greater quantity of malaria than in ordinary summers.</p>

<p>To pass from the eighth chapter, the ninth is a partial sketch of
the geography of malaria; a chapter for which the author apologises,
but which is nevertheless a very interesting collection of facts
on a subject where a volume is, doubtless, a desideratum. And it
would require a volume; while, in spite of our author’s fears, we
can really see no reason why such a statistical account of health
should not be drawn up for England, when the utility of it is
unquestionable. It is true that people cannot abandon their homes
or change their residences, because their lots happen to be cast in
an insalubrious country. But it is not less important to know what
and where these dangers are; because, though the inhabitants may be
compelled to abide, they can still correct much of the evil by the
various modes pointed out, or avoid much of the hazard by resorting
to the obvious precautions. To be ignorant, is to be exposed to the
full evil: to know where it lies, is to know how and where to avoid
it in numerous ways; since it will be found that by far the greater
number of diseases occurring, were not necessary or unavoidable, but
have been the result of ignorance as to the precise fact or spot
which did produce the effect in question. And this we conceive to
be the great use of the book before us; and that if ever it, or a
code of rules founded on it, shall become popular, or form a <em class="italic">vade
mecum</em>, particularly in the country, the effect will be to reduce
most materially the quantity of disease, and very particularly that
which is by far the most serious, the summer and autumnal fevers.
On this around, we should be glad to see a geography of malaria for
England; and we do hope that it will be undertaken by some person
of sufficient industry, and of more
<span class="xxpn" id="p108">[p108]</span>
courage than our author;
while we cannot doubt that whoever attempts it would at least find it
a profitable speculation. With these remarks we must pass over this
chapter, as we could take no statement from it which would serve any
useful purpose; though, as far as it goes, it will form a very useful
guide to travellers on the continent of Europe, or to those who, as
emigrants, are in search of a residence abroad.</p>

<p>The tenth chapter examines the inquiries which have been instituted
into the chemical nature of malaria, leaving the question just where
it was. In fact we, as chemists, do not believe that this science is
yet in possession of the means required for analyses of this delicate
nature; but we see no reason whatever why it should be despaired of,
when chemistry has already, within a very few years, effected things
which seemed far more impracticable and hopeless.</p>

<p>The eleventh and last chapter contains an enumeration of the
diseases produced by malaria, presenting a most formidable list, and
absolutely making us shudder in some of the details which relate to
the worst parts of France and Italy. The representation here given
of the average of life in these districts is particularly striking;
while of the truth of all the facts, we can speak from personal
knowledge. Our author has also noticed the effect of this poison
on animals; showing that it is the cause of the noted epidemics in
cattle, and also of the rot in sheep. If he will look into Livy, he
will find a confirmation, which he appears to have passed by when
quoting that author for epidemic seasons: this being, that in the
same years in which epidemic “pestilences” appeared among the people,
there was also a great mortality among the cattle.</p>

<p>We do not know what his own profession will say of his attempt,
or rather proposal, to prove that the celebrated disease of the
nerves called Tic Douleureux is the produce of malaria and a mode of
intermittent fever; nor how they will receive his proposal to arrange
Sciatica and Rheumatic pains, with many other local diseases, under
this head. But this is not our affair: and as he has promised us two
other volumes, on all the diseases which are produced by malaria,
including these, we must wait with patience; knowing at least that he
is a dealer in facts and not in hypotheses, and expecting, that even
if he should fail to establish his point, he will try to do it, as
he has been used to do in the other sciences which he has attempted,
through the road of facts and evidence.

Plants called</em>
<span class="smcaps">R<span>EEVESIA</span></span>. By John Lindley,
Esq., F.L.S., &#38;c. &#38;c. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">I<span>N</span></span>
a collection of dried specimens of plants sent to the
Horticultural Society from China, by Mr. Reeves, are a few branches,
with flowers, of a remarkable genus which is at present undescribed,
but which is of so curious a nature, and of such importance with
reference to the determination of some natural affinities, that I
have thought it deserving immediate record; especially as drawings
of the fruit, which have been subsequently obtained from the same
indefatigable correspondent of the Society, render its history
tolerably complete.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">branches</em> appear to be fragments of an evergreen tree; they are
slender, rounded, and smooth. The <em class="italic">nascent gemmæ</em> are covered with
a dense rufous pubescence. The <em class="italic">leaves</em> are alternate, becoming,
towards the extremities of the branches, opposite by approximation;
their form is ovate-lanceolate acuminate, and in size they vary
from three inches to nearly six in length; the surface, even of
the youngest, is perfectly smooth on each side; their veins are
inconspicuous, the lowest pair of venæ primariæ being divergent at
an angle of about 40°, while the others spread outwards at an angle
of 55° or 60°; the venæ arcuatæ and externæ are obscurely seen,
but form together a number of rhomboidal spaces, equal in diameter
to nearly one third of each side of the leaf; the proportion borne
by the petiole to the lamina is variable, sometimes equalling
one-fourth of the length of the latter, and not unfrequently being
less than one-sixth of its length: this proportion not depending
upon the station of the leaves; the petiole is smooth, half-round,
and thickened at the extremity, where it unites with the lamina.
<em class="italic">Stipulæ</em> are none. The <em class="italic">flowers</em> are greenish-white, in terminal
thyrsoid compound racemes; the upper part of the <em class="italic">rachis</em>, and of
its branches, is slightly protected by stellate pubescence; the
<em class="italic">pedicles</em> are closely covered with pubescence of the same nature,
and have one subulate downy deciduous bracteola at the base, and
another towards the apex. The <em class="italic">calyx</em> is inferior, campanulate,
tapering a little towards the base, densely clothed with stellate
pubescence, bursting irregularly at the apex into
<span class="xxpn" id="p110">[p110]</span>
four or
five ovate teeth, which are somewhat imbricated during æstivation,
but which are separated by the growth of the petals long before
the expansion of the flower; the veins of the calyx are remarkably
reticulated, and when cut, a considerable quantity of mucilaginous
viscid fluid is exuded. The <em class="italic">petals</em> are whitish-green, hypogynous,
with a convolute æstivation; their <em class="italic">ungues</em> are spatulate, and as
long as the calyx; their <em class="italic">laminæ</em> oblong, spreading flat, and
then overlapping each other at the base; at the point of separation
of the unguis and lamina is a small callus, and on each side a notch
upon the margin. The <em class="italic">stamens</em> are seated upon a long, filiform,
subclavate, smooth torus; the <em class="italic">filaments</em> are consolidated into a
capitate five-toothed cup, nearly closed at the orifice, and on
the outside of this cup are placed the <em class="italic">antheræ</em>, three to each
tooth; the latter are two-celled, with divaricating cells, which
open longitudinally, and are so entangled with each other that the
whole surface of the cup appears, when the antheræ have burst, to
consist of a single many-celled anthera. The <em class="italic">pollen</em> is spherical
and smooth. he <em class="italic">ovarium</em> is seated within the cup of stamens, and is
so entirely concealed that it cannot be discovered till some part of
the cup is removed by violence; it is ovate, smooth, and formed of
five inseparable cells, each of which has two ovula placed one above
the other, and attached to their placenta by their inner margin; the
<em class="italic">stigma</em> is sessile, with five radiating lobes. From the Chinese
drawing, the half-ripe fruit appears to be fleshy, with five deep
angles, and five cells, without any remains of calyx, and with a
slight appearance of separation between the lobes. The ripe fruit
is an obovate, five-angled, five-celled, five-valved, retuse, woody
capsule, with a loculicidal dehiscence, and no separable axis. The
seeds are attached one to each side of the valves, and are expanded
at their lower end into a wing.</p>

<p>From this description it is obvious that, with the single exception
of the contents of the seed, we are in possession of all that it is
essential to know of the structure of this plant. The next subject of
consideration is its affinity.</p>

<p>The stellate pubescence, the thickening of the petiole at the point
where it expands into the lamina, the station of the stamens upon a
long, filiform torus, the external position of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p111">[p111]</span>
antheræ,
and the union of the filaments by threes into a cup surrounding
the ovarium, are all characters that forcibly call to recollection
the genus Sterculia. The calyx, indeed, in that genus is generally
divided much more deeply than in the plant now under consideration,
and the antheræ are usually seated at the base of the ovarium;
but, on the other hand, in Sterculia colorata of Roxburgh, which,
if a distinct genus, (<span class="smcaps">E<span>RYTHROPSIS</span></span>) as I am inclined to believe; is
nevertheless next of kin to Sterculia, the calyx is of the same
figure and divided in the same degree, and the antheræ are also
combined in a capitate cup inclosing the ovarium. If, however, we
pursue this comparison further we find that, with the characters now
adverted to, the similarity ceases; in Sterculia there are no petals,
the calyx has a valvular not imbricate æstivation, the cells of the
fruit separate into distinct folliculi, and do not combine into a
solid woody capsule, and the seeds are destitute of wings.</p>

<p>The fruit suggests so obviously some affinity with Pterospermum,
that it is next necessary to institute a comparison with that
genus. Stellate pubescence, a calyx divided into five portions,
five hypogynous unguiculate petals, and fifteen fertile stamens
united into a cup, seated on a stipitiform torus, and surrounding
the ovarium, a five-celled ovarium, a woody five-celled capsule,
with a loculicidal dehiscence, no axis, and winged seeds; all these
characters are common to Pterospermum and our plant; but on the
other hand the points in which they differ are of much importance.
The æstivation of Pterospermum is valvate recurved not imbricate;
its calyx is five-parted, not four—five-toothed; its anthers have
parallel not divaricating cells, and are seated upon long distinct
filaments, not sessile, upon the outside of a capituliform cup; and
finally the petioles of the leaves are not connected with the lamina
by a thickened space. The seeds are also winged at the apex, not at
the base, but upon this point it is not my wish to insist.</p>

<p>If the comparison thus instituted with Pterospermum and Sterculia be
attentively considered, we cannot fail to remark that the subject of
these observations is nearly equally related to both; to Pterospermum
in its petals and fruit, to Sterculia in its calyx and stamens.
It must, therefore, be stationed between those two genera, thus
confirming the propriety of M.
<span class="xxpn" id="p112">[p112]</span>
Kunth’s combination of the
Sterculiaceæ of Ventenat with the Byttneriaceæ of Mr. Brown; and, in
fact, breaking down every barrier between them.</p>

<p>There are many other points that will suggest themselves to the
Botanist, in which this plant is highly worthy of consideration, but
for the present it will be enough to give the botanical characters
with which it may stand recorded. It is named in honour of John
Reeves, Esq., now resident at Canton, to whom we are indebted for
our knowledge of it, from whose unwearied exertions in the cause of
science the botany of China has received material assistance, and to
whom our gardens are indebted for many of the fairest ornaments they
contain.</p>

<p class="first">I
<span class="smmaj">SHALL</span> not undertake to explain here in detail the reasons and the
calculations which lead to the general formulas that I have employed
to determine the position of the fringes and the intensity of the
inflected rays: but I think it right to give at least a distinct idea
of the principles on which this theory rests, and particularly of the
principle of <em class="italic">interference</em>, which explains the mutual action of the
rays of light on each other. The name of interference was given by
Dr.
<span class="smcaps">Y<span>OUNG</span></span> to the law which he discovered, and of which he has made so
many ingenious applications.</p>

<p>This singular phenomenon, so difficult to be satisfactorily
explained in the system of emanation, is on the contrary so natural
a consequence of the theory of undulation, that it might have been
predicted from a general consideration of the principles of that
theory. Every body must have observed, in throwing stones into a
pond, that, when two groups of waves cross each other on its surface,
there are points at which the water remains immoveable, when the
two systems are nearly of the same magnitude, while there are
other places in which the force of the waves is augmented by their
concurrence. The reason of this is easily understood. The undulatory
motion of the surface of the water consists of vertical motions,
which alternately raise and depress the particles of the fluid. Now,
in consequence of the intersection of the waves, it happens, that
at certain points of their meeting, one of the two waves has an
ascending motion belonging to it, while the other tends at the same
instant to depress the surface of the liquid: consequently, when
the two opposite impulses are equal, it can neither be actuated by
one nor the other, but must remain at rest. On the contrary, at the
points in which the motions agree in their direction, and conspire
with each other, the liquid, urged in the same direction
<span class="xxpn" id="p114">[p114]</span>
by
each of the forces, is raised or depressed with a velocity equal
to the sum of the effects of the two separate impulses, or to the
double of either of them taken singly, since they are now supposed
to be equal. Between these points of perfect agreement and complete
opposition, which exhibit, one the total absence of motion, the other
the maximum of oscillation, there are an infinity of intermediate
points, at which the alternate motion takes place with more or less
of energy, accordingly as they approach more or less to the places of
perfect agreement, or of complete opposition of the two systems of
motion which are thus combined, or superinduced on each other.</p>

<p>The waves which are propagated in the interior of an elastic fluid,
though very different in their nature from those of a liquid like
water, produce mechanical effects by their interference, which are
exactly of the same kind, since they consist in alternate oscillatory
motions of the particles of the fluid. In fact, it is sufficient that
these motions should be oscillatory, that is, that the particles
should be carried by them alternately in opposite directions, in
order that the effects of one series of waves may be destroyed by
those of another series of equal intensity; for, provided that the
difference of the route of the two groups of waves [derived from the
same origin] be such, that for each point of the fluid the motions
in one direction, belonging to the first series, correspond to the
motions, belonging to the second, in the opposite direction, they
must perfectly neutralise each other, if their intensity is equal:
and the particles of the fluid must remain in repose. This result
will always hold good, whatever may happen to be the direction of the
oscillatory motion, with regard to that in which the undulations are
propagated; provided that the direction of the oscillatory motion be
the same in the two series to be combined. In the waves which are
formed on the surface of a liquid, for example, the direction of the
oscillation is [principally] vertical, while the waves are propagated
horizontally, and consequently in a direction perpendicular to the
former; in the undulations of sound, on the contrary, the oscillatory
motion is parallel to the direction of the propagation of the sound,
[or rather is
<span class="xxpn" id="p115">[p115]</span>
identical with it]; and these undulations, as
well as the waves of water, are subject to the laws of interference.</p>

<p>The undulations formed in the interior of a fluid have here been
mentioned in a general manner: in order to form a distinct idea of
this mode of propagation, it must be remarked, that when the fluid
has the same density and the same elasticity in every direction,
the agitation produced in any point must be propagated on all sides
with the same velocity: for this velocity of propagation, which
must not be confounded with the absolute velocity of the particles,
depends only on the density and elasticity of the fluid. It follows
thence that all the points, agitated at the same instant in a
similar manner, must be found in a spherical surface, having for its
centre the point which is the origin of the agitation: so that these
undulations are spherical, while the waves, which are seen on the
surface of a liquid, are simply circular.</p>

<p>We give the name of <em class="italic">rays</em> to the right lines drawn from the centre
of agitation to the different points of this spherical surface; and
these rays are the directions in which the motion is propagated.
This is the meaning of the term <em class="italic">sonorous rays</em> in acustics, and of
<em class="italic">luminous rays</em> or <em class="italic">rays of light</em> in the system which attributes the
phenomena of light to the vibrations of a universal fluid, to which
the name of ether has been given.</p>

<p>The nature of the different elementary motions, of which each
wave is composed, depends on the nature of the different motions
which constitute the primitive agitation. The simplest hypothesis
that can be entertained concerning the formation of the luminous
undulations, is, that the small oscillations of the particles of the
bodies, which produce them, are analogous to those of a pendulum
removed but little from its point of rest; for we must conceive the
particles of bodies, not as immoveably fixed in the positions which
they occupy, but as suspended by forces which form an equilibrium
in all directions. Now, whatever the nature of such forces may
be, as long as the displacement of the particles is but small in
proportion to the extent of their sphere of action, the accelerating
force which tends to restore them to their natural position, and
which thus causes them to oscillate on each side of it, may always,
without sensible error, be considered as proportional
<span class="xxpn" id="p116">[p116]</span>
to the
magnitude of that displacement: so that the law of their motion must
be the same as that of the motion of the pendulum, and of all small
oscillations in general. This hypothesis, which is suggested by the
analogy with other natural phenomena, and which is the simplest that
can be formed respecting the vibrations of the luminous particles,
may be considered as experimentally confirmed by the observation,
that the optical properties of light are all independent of any
circumstances which cause the greatest difference in the intensity of
the vibrations: so that the law of their motion must be presumed to
be the same for the greatest as for the smallest.</p>

<p>It follows from this hypothesis respecting the small oscillations,
that the velocity of the vibrating particle at each instant is
proportional to the sine of an arc, representing the time elapsed
from the beginning of the motion, taking the circumference for the
whole time required for the return of the particle to the same point,
that is, the time occupied by two oscillations, the one forwards
and the other backwards. Such is the law according to which I have
calculated the formulas which serve to determine the effect of any
number of systems of waves of which the intensities and the relative
positions are given. These formulas will be found in the Annals of
Chemistry, vol. xi., page 254: [they may be applied with security to
the phenomena there considered, though the perfect accuracy of the
hypothesis in all possible cases may be questioned, upon the grounds
of the microscopical observations on the motions of vibrating chords,
published by Dr. Young in the Philosophical Transactions for 1800.
<span class="smcaps">T<span>R.</span></span>] Without entering into the details of the calculations, I think
it necessary to show in what manner the nature of the undulation
depends on the kind of motion of the vibrating particles.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, in the fluid, a little solid plane which is removed
from its primitive position, towards which it is urged by a force
proportional to the distance. At the beginning of its motion, the
accelerative force produces in it an infinitely small velocity only;
but its action continuing, the effects become accumulated, and the
velocity of the solid plane goes on continually to increase, until
the moment of its arrival at
<span class="xxpn" id="p117">[p117]</span>
the position of equilibrium, in
which it would remain, but for the velocity which it has acquired;
and it is by this velocity only, that it is carried beyond the point
of equilibrium. The same force which tends towards this point,
and which now begins to act in a contrary direction, continually
diminishes the velocity, until it is completely annihilated; and then
the force continuing its action produces a velocity in the contrary
direction, which brings the plane back to its place of equilibrium.
This velocity again is very small at the commencement of the return
of the particle, or plane, and increases by the same degrees as
it had before diminished, until the instant of the arrival of the
particle at the neutral point, which it passes with the velocity
previously acquired: but when it has passed this point, the motion is
diminished more and more by the effect of the force tending towards
it, and its velocity is reduced to nothing when it arrives at the
place of the commencement of the motion. It then recommences, at
similar periods, the series of motions which have been described,
and would continue to oscillate for ever, but for the effect of
the resistance of the surrounding fluid, the inertia of which
continually diminishes the amplitude of its oscillations, and finally
extinguishes them at the end of a longer or shorter time, according
to circumstances. [It must not be inferred from this explanation,
that the particles of a fluid transmitting an undulation have any
tendency to vibrate for ever: on the contrary it has been admitted by
the best writers on the theory of sound, that all the motions which
constitute it, as considered in a fluid, are completely transitory
in their nature, and have no disposition to be repeated after having
been once transmitted to a remoter part of the fluid.
<span class="smcaps">T<span>R.</span></span>]</p>

<p>Let us now consider in what manner the fluid is agitated by these
oscillations of the solid plane. The stratum immediately in contact
with it, being urged by the plane, receives from it at each instant
the velocity of its motion, and communicates it to the neighbouring
stratum, which it forces forwards in its turn, and from which the
motion is communicated successively to the other strata of the
fluid; but this transmission of the motion is not instantaneous,
and it is only at the end of a certain time that it arrives at a
determinate
<span class="xxpn" id="p118">[p118]</span>
distance from the centre of agitation. This
time is the shorter, as the fluid is less dense, and more elastic;
that is, composed of particles which possess a greater repulsive
force. This being granted, let us assume, in order to facilitate the
explanation, the moment when the moveable plane is returned to the
initial situation, after having performed two complete oscillations
in opposite directions: at this moment, the nascent velocity, which
it had at first, is transmitted to a stratum of the fluid removed
from the centre of agitation by a distance which we may represent
by <em class="italic">d</em>. Immediately afterwards, the velocity of the moveable plane,
which has a little augmented, has been communicated to the stratum in
contact with it: “hence <em class="italic">it</em> has passed successively through all the
following strata;” and at the moment when the first agitation arrives
at the stratum of which the distance is <em class="italic">d</em>, the second has arrived
at the stratum immediately before it. Continuing thus to divide, in
our imagination, the duration of the two oscillations of the moveable
plane into an infinity of small intervals of time, and the fluid
comprehended in the length <em class="italic">d</em>, into an equal number of infinitely
thin strata, it is easy to perceive, by the same reasoning, that
the different velocities of the moveable plane, at each of these
instants, are now distributed among the corresponding strata; and
that thus, for example, the velocity which the plane possessed at the
middle of the first oscillations in the direction of the motion, must
have arrived, at the instant in question, at the distance
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span>
<em class="italic">d</em>: so
that it is the stratum at this distance which possesses at the moment
the greatest direct velocity; and in the same manner when the plane
arrived at the limit of its first direct oscillation, its velocity
was extinguished, and the same absence of motion will be found at the
distance
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span> <em class="italic">d</em>.</p>

<p>It is always supposed, that the oscillations of the plane are so
minute in comparison with the length <em class="italic">d</em>, that their extent may
be neglected in this calculation: and this hypothesis is actually
consistent with the fact, since there is every reason to suppose
that the excursions of the incandescent particles are very small
in comparison with the extent of an undulation, which, though an
extremely minute space, is still an appreciable quantity, and may be
actually measured. Besides,
<span class="xxpn" id="p119">[p119]</span>
even if the amplitude of these
oscillations were not in the first instance so wholly inconsiderable,
it would be sufficient to consider an undulation at a greater
distance from the centre of agitation, in order that their extent
might be diminished in any required proportion.</p>

<p>In the second, or retrograde oscillation, the plane, returning
through the same space, must communicate to the stratum of fluid
in contact with it, and to the rest in succession, a motion in
a direction contrary to that of the first oscillation; for when
the plane recedes, the stratum in contact with it, urged against
the plane by the elasticity or the expansive force of the fluid,
necessarily follows it, and fills up the vacuum which its retrograde
motion tends to produce. For the same reason, the second stratum is
urged against the first, the third against the second, and so forth.
It is thus that the retrograde motion is communicated, step by step,
to the most distant strata: its propagation is effected according to
the same law that governs the direct motion; the only difference is
in the direction of the motions, or, in the language of mathematics,
in the sign of the velocities which are imparted to the molecules
of the fluid. We see then that the different velocities which have
existed in the solid plane, during its second oscillation, must exist
at the moment which we are considering, in the different strata
comprehended in the other half of <em class="italic">d</em>, but with contrary signs. Thus
the velocity, for example, which the plane had in the middle of the
second oscillation, which is its maximum of retrograde velocity, must
now be found in the fluid stratum situated at the distance
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span> <em class="italic">d</em>
from the centre of agitation, while the maximum of direct velocity is
found, at the same instant, in the stratum which is at the distance
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span>
<em class="italic">d</em> from the centre of agitation.</p>

<p>The extent of the fluid, agitated by the two opposite
oscillations of the solid plane, is what we call the breadth of
an <em class="italic">entire undulation</em>, and we may consequently give the name of
<em class="italic">semiundulation</em> to each of the parts actuated by the opposite
undulations; the whole constituting a <em class="italic">complete oscillation</em>, since
it comprehends the return of the vibrating plane to the initial
situation. It is obvious, that the two semiundulations, which compose
the complete undulation, exhibit, in
<span class="xxpn" id="p120">[p120]</span>
the fluid strata which
they contain, velocities absolutely equal in magnitude, but with
contrary signs, that is to say, carrying the particles of the fluid
in opposite directions. These velocities are the greatest in the
middle of each of the semiundulations, and decrease gradually towards
their extremities, where they entirely vanish: so that the points
of rest, and of the greatest velocities positive and negative, are
separated from each other by intervals of one fourth of an undulation.</p>

<p>The length of an undulation, <em class="italic">d</em>, depends on two things: first, on
the promptitude with which the motion is propagated in the fluid;
and secondly, the duration of the complete oscillation of the
vibrating plane; for the longer this duration, and the more rapid the
propagation of the motion, the greater will be the distance to which
the first agitation has been extended at the instant of the return of
the solid plane to its initial situation. If the oscillations are all
performed in the same medium, the velocity of propagation remaining
the same, the length of the undulations will be simply proportional
to the duration of the oscillations of the vibrating particles from
which they originate. As long as the vibrating particles continue
to be subjected to the same forces, it follows from the principles
of mechanics that each of their minute oscillations will occupy the
same time, whatever their extent may be; so that the corresponding
undulations of the fluid will continue to be of the same length; they
will only differ from each other in the greater or less extent of the
elementary vibrations of the particles, which will be proportional
to the extent of the luminous particles; for it appears from what
has already been stated, that each stratum of the fluid repeats
exactly all the motions of the vibrating particle. The greater
or less amplitude of the oscillations of the strata of the fluid
determines the degree of absolute velocity with which they move, and
consequently the energy, but not the nature of the sensation which
they excite, which must depend, according to every analogy, upon
the duration of the oscillations. It is thus that the nature of the
sounds, transmitted by the air to our ears, depends entirely on the
duration of each of the oscillations executed by the air, or by the
sonorous
<span class="xxpn" id="p121">[p121]</span>
body which puts it in motion; and that the greater
or less amplitude or energy of the oscillations only augments or
diminishes the intensity of the sound, without changing its nature,
that is, its tone, or pitch.</p>

<p>The intensity of the light must depend then on the intensity of
the vibrations of the ether; and its nature, that is to say, the
sensation of colour that it produces, will depend on the duration
of each oscillation, or on the length of the undulation, the one of
these being proportional to the other. [We find, however, nothing in
light of the same colour that is at all analogous to the different
register, quality, or <em class="italic">timbre</em> of a sound; by which, for instance,
the sound of a violin differs from that of a flute in unison with it:
the subordinate, or harmonic tones of the sound having nothing in
light to correspond with them.
<span class="smcaps">T<span>R.</span></span>]</p>

<p>The duration of the elementary oscillation remaining the same, the
absolute velocity of the ethereal particles, at the corresponding
periods of the oscillatory motions, is, as we have seen, proportional
to its extent. It is the square of this velocity, multiplied by the
density of the fluid, that represents what is called the living force
in mechanics, or otherwise the energy or impetus of the particles,
which is to be taken as the measure of the sensation produced, or of
the intensity of the light: thus, for example, if in the same medium,
the amplitude of the oscillation is doubled, the absolute velocities
will also be doubled, and the living force, or the intensity of the
light, will be quadrupled.</p>

<p>We must, however, take care not to confound this absolute velocity
of the particles of the fluid with the velocity of the propagation
of the agitation. The first varies according to the amplitude of
the oscillations; the second, which is nothing but the promptitude
with which the motion is communicated from one stratum to the other,
is independent of the intensity of the vibrations. It is for this
reason, that a weak sound is transmitted by the air with the same
velocity as a stronger one; and that the least intense light is
propagated with the same rapidity as the brightest. When we speak
of the velocity of light, we always speak of the velocity of its
propagation. Thus, when we say that light passes through 200 thousand
<span class="xxpn" id="p122">[p122]</span>
miles in a second, we do not mean, according to the undulatory
system, that such is the absolute velocity of the ethereal particles;
but that the motion communicated to the ether employs only a second
to pass to a stratum at the distance of 200 thousand miles from its
origin.</p>

<p>In proportion as the undulation becomes more distant from the centre
of agitation, the motion, spreading over a greater distance, must be
weakened in every part of the wave. It is shown by calculation, that
the amplitude of the oscillatory motion, or the absolute velocity
of the particles concerned in it, is inversely proportional to the
distance from the centre of agitation. Consequently, the square
of this velocity is inversely proportional to the square of the
distance, and the intensity of the light must be inversely as the
square of the distance from the luminous point. It must be remarked,
that, for the same reasons, the sum of the living forces of the
whole undulation remains unaltered; for, on one side the length
of the undulation <em class="italic">d</em>, which may also be called its thickness, is
invariable, and its extent of surface augmenting in proportion to
the square of the distance from the centre, the quantity, or mass of
the fluid agitated, is proportional to the same square: and since
the squares of the absolute velocities are diminished in the same
proportion as the masses have augmented, it follows that the sum of
the products of the masses by the squares of the velocities, that
is to say, the sum of the living forces, remains unaltered. It is a
general principle of the motion of elastic fluids, that however the
motion may be extended or subdivided, the total sum of the living
forces remains constant; and this is the principal reason why the
living force must be considered as the measure of light, of which the
total quantity always remains very nearly the same, at least as long
as it continues to pass through perfectly transparent mediums.</p>

<p>It may be remarked, that black substances, and even the most
brilliant metallic surfaces, by no means reflect the whole of the
light which falls on them; bodies which are imperfectly transparent,
and even the most transparent, when of great thickness, absorb also,
to use a common expression, a considerable portion of the light that
is passing through
<span class="xxpn" id="p123">[p123]</span>
them: but it must not be inferred that
the principle of living forces is inapplicable to these phenomena;
it follows, on the contrary, from the most probable idea that can
be formed of the mechanical constitution of bodies, that the sum
of the living force must remain always the same, as long as the
accelerating forces tending to bring the particles to their natural
positions remain unchanged, and that the quantity of living force
which disappears in the state of light, instead of being annihilated,
is reproduced in the form of heat.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a correct idea of the manner in which the
oscillation of a small solid body occasions undulations in an elastic
fluid, it has been only necessary to consider a complete oscillation
of the solid plane, which produces an entire undulation. If we
suppose the oscillations of the plane to be continually repeated,
we shall have a series of undulations instead of a single one: and
they will follow each other without intermission, provided that the
vibrations of the particle first agitated have been regular. Such a
series of regular and uninterrupted luminous motions I call a <em class="italic">system
of undulations</em>.</p>

<p>It is natural to suppose, on account of the prodigious rapidity
of the vibrations of light, that the luminous particles may
perform a great number of regular oscillations in each of the
different mechanical situations in which they are placed during
the combustion or the incandescence of the luminous body, although
these circumstances may still succeed each other in extremely short
periods; for the millionth part of a second is sufficient to exhibit,
for example, 545 millions of undulations of yellow light; so that
the mechanical disturbances, which derange the regular succession
of the vibrations of the luminous particles, or which even change
their nature, might be repeated a million times in a second without
preventing the regular succession of more than 500 millions of
consecutive undulations in each state of the particle. We shall soon
have occasion to apply this observation to the determination of the
circumstances in which the interference of luminous waves is capable
of producing sensible effects.</p>

<p>We have seen that each undulation produced by an oscillatory motion
was composed of two semiundulations, which
<span class="xxpn" id="p124">[p124]</span>
occasioned in the
particles of the fluids velocities exactly equal in their intensity,
though opposite in the direction of the motions. Let us at first
suppose that two whole undulations, moving in the same line and in
the same direction, differ half an undulation in their progress:
they will then be superinduced on each other through one half of
their length, or of their breadth, as we should say in speaking
of the waves of a liquid: but I here use in preference the term
length as applied to the interval between the two points which are
similarly affected by the motions of two consecutive undulations.
In the supposed case of the coincidence of one half of each of the
undulations, the interference will only take place with respect to
the parts so coinciding: that is, to the latter half of the first
undulation, and the preceding half of the second: and if these two
semiundulations are of equal intensity, since they tend to give, to
the same points of the ether, impulses directly opposite, they will
wholly neutralise each other, and the motion will be destroyed in
this part of the fluid, while it will subsist without alteration in
the two other halves of the undulations. In such a case, therefore,
half of the motion only would be destroyed.</p>

<p>If now we suppose that each of these undulations, differing in their
progress by half the whole length of each, is preceded and followed
by a great number of other similar undulations; then, instead of
the interference of two detached undulations, we must consider the
interference of two systems of waves, which may be supposed equal
in their number and their intensity. Since, by the hypothesis, they
differ half an undulation in their progress, the semiundulations of
the one, which tend to cause in the particles of ether a motion in
one direction, coincide with the semiundulations of the other, which
urge them in the opposite direction, and these two forces hold each
other in equilibrium, so that the motion is wholly destroyed in the
whole extent of these two systems of waves, except the two extreme
semiundulations, which escape from the interference. But these
semiundulations will always constitute a very small part of the whole
series to be considered.</p>

<p>This reasoning is obviously applicable to such systems only
<span class="xxpn" id="p125">[p125]</span>
as are composed of undulations of the same length; for if the waves
were longer one than the other, however small their difference might
be, it would happen at last that their relative position would not
be the same throughout the extent of the groups; and while the
first destroyed each other almost completely, the following ones
would be less in opposition, and would ultimately agree completely
with each other: hence there would arise a succession of weak and
strong vibrations analogous to the beatings which are produced by
the coincidence of two sounds differing but little from each other
in their tone; but these alternations of weaker and stronger light,
succeeding each other with prodigious rapidity, would produce in the
eye a continuous sensation only.</p>

<p>It is very probable that the impulse of a single luminous
semiundulation, or even of an entire undulation, would be too weak
to agitate the particles of the optic nerve, as we find that a
single undulation of sound is incapable of causing motion in a body
susceptible of a sympathetic vibration. It is the succession of the
impulse, which, by the accumulation of the single effects, at last
causes the sonorous body to oscillate in a sensible manner; in the
same manner as the regular succession of the single efforts of a
ringer is at last capable of raising the heaviest church bell into
full swing. Applying this mechanical idea to vision, supported as it
is by so many analogies, we may easily conceive that it is impossible
for the two remaining semiundulations, which have been mentioned, to
produce any sensible effect on the retina; and that the result of
such a combination of the two systems must be the production of total
darkness.</p>

<p>If again we suppose the second system of undulations to be again
retarded half an undulation more, so as to make the difference of the
progress an entire undulation, the coincidence in the motions of the
two groups will be again restored, and the velocities of oscillation
will conspire and be augmented in the points of superposition; the
intensity of the light being then at its maximum.</p>

<p>Adding another semiundulation to the difference in the progress of
the two systems, so as to make it an interval and
<span class="xxpn" id="p126">[p126]</span>
a half, it
is obvious that the semiundulations, superinduced on each other,
will now possess opposite qualities, as in the case of the half
interval first supposed: and that all the undulations must in this
manner be neutralised, except the extreme three semiundulations on
each side, which will be free from interference. Thus almost the
whole of the motion will again be destroyed, and the combination of
the two pencils of light must produce darkness, as in the case first
considered.</p>

<p>Continuing to increase the supposed difference by the length of a
semiundulation at each step, we shall have alternately complete
darkness and a maximum of light, accordingly as the difference
amounts to an odd or an even number of semiundulations: that is,
supposing always that the systems of undulations are of equal
intensity: for if the one series were less vivid than the other, they
would be incapable of destroying them altogether: the velocities of
the one series would be subtracted from those of the other, since
they would tend to move the particles of the ether in contrary
directions, but the remainders would still constitute light, though
feebler than that of the strongest single pencil. Thus the second
pencil would still occasion a diminution of the light: but the
diminution would be the less sensible as the pencil is supposed to be
weaker.</p>

<p>Such are the consequences of the principle of the interference
of undulations, which agree perfectly, as we have seen, with the
law of the mutual influence of the luminous rays which is deduced
from experiment: for the results are expressed precisely in the
same words, if we give the name of <em class="italic">length of undulation</em> to the
difference of routes which had been represented by the symbol <em class="italic">d</em>.
Admitting, therefore, as there is every reason to believe, that light
consists in the undulations of a subtile fluid, the period <em class="italic">d</em>, after
which the same effects of interference are repeated, must be the
length of an undulation.</p>

<p>It appears from the table already given for the seven principal
kinds of coloured rays, that this period <em class="italic">d</em>, or the length of the
undulation, varies greatly, according to the
<span class="xxpn" id="p127">[p127]</span>
colour of the
light, and that for the extreme red rays, for example, it is [more
than] half as great again as for the violet rays situated at the
other extremity of the spectrum.</p>

<p>It may easily be imagined that the number of different undulations is
not limited to the seven principal ones which are indicated in the
table, and that there must be a multitude of intermediate magnitudes,
and others beyond the red and the violet rays: for the ponderable
particles, of which the oscillations give rise to them, must be
subjected to forces that are infinitely varied, in the combustion
or the incandescence of the bodies which excite the motions of the
ether: and it is on the energy of these forces that the duration
of each oscillation depends, and consequently the length of the
undulation produced by it. It is found that all the undulations
comprehended [in the air] between the lengths .0000167 E.I. and
.0000244, are visible; that is, are capable of exciting vibrations in
the optic nerve: the rest are only sensible by their heat, or by the
chemical effects which they produce.</p>

<p>It has been remarked, that when two systems of waves differ half
an undulation in their progress, two of the semiundulations must
escape from interference; that six must be exempt when the difference
amounts to three semiundulations; and that, in general, the number
of undulations exempt from interference is equal to the number of
lengths of a semiundulation separating the corresponding points of
the two systems. While this number is very small in proportion to
that of the waves contained in each system, the motion must be nearly
destroyed, as in the case of the exemption of a single undulation.
But it may be imagined that, as we increase the difference of
the progress of the two pencils, the undulations exempted from
interference may become a material portion of each group, and that
it may finally become so great as to separate the groups entirely
from each other; and in this case the phenomena of interference would
no longer be observable. If, for example, the groups of undulations
consisted but of a thousand each, a difference of one-twentieth of an
inch in their routes would be much more than sufficient to prevent
the interference of the rays of all kinds.
<span class="xxpn" id="p128">[p128]</span></p>

<p>But there is another much more powerful reason which prevents our
perceiving the effects of the mutual influence of the systems of
waves when the difference of their routes is considerable; which is
the impossibility of rendering the light sufficiently homogeneous:
for the most simple light that we can obtain consists still of an
infinity of heterogeneous rays, which have not exactly the same
length of undulation; and however slight the difference may be, when
it is repeated a great number of times, it produces of necessity, as
we have already seen, an opposition between the modes of interference
of the various rays, which then compensates for the weakening of some
by the strengthening of others; [while the shades of colour are not
sufficiently distinct to allow the eye to remark the difference.]
This is without doubt the principal reason why the effects of the
mutual interference of the rays of light become insensible when the
difference of the routes is very considerable, so as to amount to 50
or 60 times the length of an undulation.</p>

<p>It has already been laid down as one of the conditions necessary for
the appearance of the phenomena of interference, that the rays which
are combined should have issued at first from a common source: and it
is easy to account for the necessity of this condition by the theory
which has now been explained.</p>

<p>Every system of waves, which meets another, always exercises on
it the same influence when their relative positions are the same,
whether it originates from the same source or from different sources;
for it is clear that the reasons, by which their mutual influence
has been explained, would be equally applicable to either case. But
it is not sufficient that this influence should exist, in order that
it may become sensible to our eyes: and for this purpose the effect
must have a certain degree of permanence. Now this cannot happen when
the two systems of waves which interfere are derived from separate
sources. For it is obvious that the particles of luminous bodies,
of which the vibrations agitate the ether, and produce light, must
be liable to very frequent disturbances in their oscillations, in
consequence of the rapid changes which are taking place around them,
which may
<span class="xxpn" id="p129">[p129]</span>
nevertheless be perfectly reconciled, as we have
seen, with the regular continuance of a great number of oscillations
in each of the series separated by these perturbations. This being
admitted, it is impossible to suppose that these perturbations should
take place simultaneously and in the same manner in the vibrations
of separate and independent particles; so that it will happen, for
example, that the motions of the one will be retarded by an entire
semioscillation, while those of the other will be continued without
interruption, or will be retarded by a complete oscillation, a change
which will completely invert the whole effects of the interference of
the two systems of undulations which originate from them; since if
they had agreed on the first supposition, they would totally disagree
on the second. Now these opposite effects, succeeding each other with
extreme rapidity, will produce in the eye a continuous sensation
only, which will be a mean between the more or less lively sensations
that they excite, and will remain constant, whatever may be the
difference of the routes described.</p>

<p>But the case is different when the two luminous pencils originate
from a common source: for then the two systems of waves, having
originated from the same centre of vibration, undergoing these
perturbations in the same manner and at the same instant, undergo no
changes in their relative positions: so that if they disagreed in the
first instance at any given point, they would continue to disagree at
all other times; and if their motions cooperated at first, they would
continue to agree as long as the centre of vibration continued to be
luminous: so that in this case, the effects must remain constant,
and must therefore be sensible to the eye. This is therefore a
general principle, applicable to all the effects produced by luminous
undulations; that in order to become sensible, they must be permanent.</p>

<p>We have hitherto supposed that the two systems of waves were moving
exactly in the same direction, and that consequently their elementary
motions, to be combined with each other, were precisely limited to
one single line: this is the simplest case of interference, and the
only one in which the one motion can be completely destroyed by the
other:
<span class="xxpn" id="p130">[p130]</span>
for in order that this effect may be produced, not only
the two forces must be equal and in contrary directions, but they
must also act in the same right line, or be directly opposed to each
other.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of coloured rings, and that of the colours developed
by polarised light in crystallised plates, present a particular case
of interference, in which the undulations are exactly parallel. But
in the phenomena of diffraction, or in the experiment with the two
mirrors, which has been already described, the rays which interfere
always form sensible though very small angles with each other. In
these cases the impulses to be combined with each other at the same
points, as belonging to the two systems of undulations, will also act
in directions forming sensible angles with each other: but on account
of the smallness of these angles, the result of the two impulses
is almost exactly equal to their sum, when the impulses act in the
same direction, and to their difference, when they are in contrary
directions. Thus, in the points of agreement or disagreement, the
intensity of the light will be the same as if the directions agreed
more perfectly; at least the nicest eye will not be able to discover
any difference in them. But although, with respect to the intensity
of the light, this case of interference resembles that which has
already been considered, there are other differences which modify the
phenomenon very greatly, both with respect to its general form, and
to the circumstances necessary for producing it.</p>

<p>We may take, as a convenient example, the case of diverging rays
originating from the same luminous point, and reflected by two
mirrors slightly inclined to each other, so as to produce two pencils
meeting each other in a sensible angle: the two systems of waves
will then meet each other with a slight inclination; and it follows
from this obliquity, that if a semiundulation of the first system
coincides perfectly in one point with a semiundulation of the second,
urging the fluid in the same direction, it must separate from it to
the right and left of the point of intersection, and must coincide,
a little further off, on one side with the preceding semiundulation
which is in a contrary direction,
<span class="xxpn" id="p131">[p131]</span>
and on the other side with
the following semiundulation, and then be separated from this again,
and at a distance twice as great as the first, must coincide with
the second semiundulation before and behind it, of which the actions
will coincide with its own: whence there will arise, on the surface
of this undulation, a series of lines, at equal distances from each
other, in which the motion is destroyed and doubled alternately by
the action of the second series. Thus if we receive this luminous
undulation on a white card, we shall observe on it a series of
dark and bright stripes, if the light employed is homogeneous; or
coloured fringes of different tints, if we employ white light for the
experiment.</p>

<div class="figc-s4">
<img src="images/i131.jpg" width="348" height="435" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This will be more easily understood by the inspection of a figure,
which represents a section of the two mirrors and of the reflected
undulations, formed by a plane drawn from the luminous point
perpendicularly to the mirrors represented by
<span class="allcaps">DE</span> and <span class="allcaps">DF</span>. The luminous
point is supposed to be S, and A and B are the geometrical positions
of its two images, which are determined by the perpendiculars
<span class="allcaps">SA</span>
and <span class="allcaps">SB</span> falling from S on the mirrors, taking in them
<span class="allcaps">PA</span>&#160;= <span class="allcaps">SP</span>
<span class="xxpn" id="p132">[p132]</span>
and <span class="allcaps">QB</span>&#160;= <span class="allcaps">SQ</span>.
The points A and B, thus found, are the centres of
divergence of the rays reflected from the respective mirrors,
according to the well known law of reflection. Thus, in order to
have the direction of the ray reflected at any point G of the mirror
<span class="allcaps">DF</span>, for example, it is sufficient to draw a right line through B and
G, which will be the direction of the reflected ray. Now it must be
remarked, that, according to the construction by which the position
of B is found, the distances <span class="allcaps">BG</span> and <span class="allcaps">SG</span> will be equal, and thus the
whole route of the ray coming from S and arriving at <em class="italic">b</em>, is the
same as if it had come from B. This geometrical truth being equally
applicable to all the rays reflected by the same mirror, it is
obvious that they will arrive at the same instant at all the points
of the circumference <em class="italic">n′bm</em>, described on the point B as a centre,
with a radius equal to B<em class="italic">b</em>; consequently this surface will represent
the surface of the reflected undulation when it arrives at <em class="italic">b</em>, or,
more correctly speaking, its intersection with the plane of the
figure: the surface of the undulation being understood as relating
to the points which are similarly agitated at the same instant: the
points being all, at the commencement of the whole oscillation, for
example, or at the middle or the end, completely at rest; and in the
middle of each semioscillation, possessed of the maximum of velocity.</p>

<p>In order to represent the two systems of reflected undulations, there
are drawn, with the points A and B for their centres, two different
series of equidistant arcs, separated from each other by an interval
which is supposed equal to the length of a semiundulation. In order
to distinguish the motions in opposite directions, the arcs on which
the motions of the ethereal particles are supposed to be direct, are
represented by full lines, and the maximum of the retrograde motions
are indicated by dotted lines. It follows that the intersections
of the dotted lines with the full lines are points of complete
discordance, and of course show the middle of the dark stripes; and,
on the contrary, the intersections of similar arcs show the points
of perfect agreement, or the middle of the bright stripes. The
intersections of the arcs of the same kind are joined by the dotted
lines <em class="italic">b′p′</em>, <em class="italic">br</em>,
<em class="italic">b′p′</em>, and those of arcs of
<span class="xxpn" id="p133">[p133]</span>
different
kinds by the full lines <em class="italic">n′o′</em>, <em class="italic">no</em>, <em class="italic">no</em>, <em class="italic">n′o′</em>: these latter
representing the successive positions or the trajectories of the
middle points of the dark stripes, and the former the trajectories of
the bright bands.</p>

<p>It has been necessary to magnify very greatly in this figure the real
length of the luminous undulations, and to exaggerate the mutual
inclination of the two mirrors, so that we must not expect an exact
representation of the phenomenon, but merely a mode of illustrating
the distribution of the interferences, in undulations which cross
each other with a slight inclination.</p>

<p>It is easy to deduce from geometrical considerations, that the length
of these fringes is in the inverse ratio of the magnitude of the
angle made by the two pencils which interfere, and that the interval,
comprehended between the middle points of two consecutive dark or
bright bands, is as much greater than the length of the undulation,
as the radius is greater than the sine of the angle of intersection.</p>

<p>In fact the triangle <em class="italic">bni</em>, formed by the right line <em class="italic">bi</em>, and the
two circular arcs <em class="italic">ni</em> and <em class="italic">nb</em>, may be considered as rectilinear
and isosceles, on account of the smallness of the arcs; and the
sine of the angle <em class="italic">bni</em>, considered as very small, may be called
<span class="fract"><span class="fup"><em class="italic">ib</em></span><span class="fdn"><em class="italic">bn</em></span></span>:
so that <em class="italic">bn</em> being the radius, <em class="italic">ib</em> will represent the
sine of the angle <em class="italic">bni</em>, which has its legs perpendicular to those
of the angle A<em class="italic">b</em>B: consequently, these angles being equal, one of
them may be substituted for the other; and representing by <em class="italic">i</em> the
angle A<em class="italic">b</em>B, formed by the reflected rays, we have <em class="italic">bn</em>&#160;=
<span class="fract"><span class="fup"><em class="italic">ib</em></span><span class="fdn">sin <em class="italic">i</em></span></span>;
consequently <em class="italic">nn</em>, which is twice <em class="italic">bn</em>, will be equal to
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2<em class="italic">ib</em></span><span class="fdn">sin <em class="italic">i</em></span></span>.
But <em class="italic">nn</em> is the distance between the middle points
of two consecutive dark stripes, and is the distance which has
been called the breadth of a fringe; and <em class="italic">ib</em> being the breadth
of a semiundulation, according to the construction of the figure,
2<em class="italic">ib</em> will be that of a whole undulation; consequently the breadth
of a fringe may be said to be equal to the length of an undulation
divided by the [numerical] sine of the angle made by the reflected
rays <span class="xxpn" id="p134">[p134]</span>
with each other, which is also the angle under which the
interval <span class="allcaps">AB</span> would appear to an eye placed at <em class="italic">b</em>. We find another
equivalent formula, by remarking that the two triangles, <em class="italic">bni</em> and
A<em class="italic">b</em>B, are similar, whence we have the proportion <em class="italic">bn</em>: <em class="italic">bi</em>&#160;=
A<em class="italic">b</em>&#160;: <span class="allcaps">AB</span>, and <em class="italic">bn</em>&#160;=
<span class="fract"><span class="fup"><em class="italic">bi</em> × A<em class="italic">b</em></span><span class="fdn">AB</span></span>,
or 2<em class="italic">bn</em>&#160;=
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2<em class="italic">bi</em> × A<em class="italic">b</em></span><span class="fdn">AB</span></span>:
which implies that we may find the numerical breadth of a fringe
by multiplying the length of an undulation by the distance of the
images A and B from the plane on which the fringes are measured, and
dividing the product by the distance of the two images.</p>

<p>It is sufficient to inspect the figure, in order to be convinced of
the necessity of having the two mirrors nearly in the same plane, if
we wish to obtain fringes of tolerably large dimensions; for in the
little triangle <em class="italic">bni</em>, the side <em class="italic">bi</em>, which represents the length of
a semiundulation, being little more than the hundred thousandth of an
inch for the yellow rays, for example, the side <em class="italic">bn</em>, which measures
the half breadth of a fringe, can only become sensible when <em class="italic">bn</em>
is very little inclined to <em class="italic">in</em>, so that their intersection may be
remote from <em class="italic">ib</em>; and the inclination of <em class="italic">bn</em> to <em class="italic">in</em> depends on the
distance <span class="allcaps">AB</span>, which is the measure of the inclination of the mirrors.</p>

<p>If A and B, instead of being the images of the luminous point, were
the projections of two very fine slits cut in a screen <span class="allcaps">RN</span>, through
which the rays of light were admitted from a luminous point placed
behind the screen in the continuation of the line <em class="italic">b</em>DC, the two
paths described between the point and the slits A and B being equal,
it would be sufficient to compute the paths described by the rays,
beginning from A and B, in order to have the differences of their
lengths; and it is obvious in this case, that the calculations which
we have been making of the breadth of the fringes, produced by the
two mirrors, would remain equally applicable, at least as long as
each slit remained narrow enough to be considered as a single centre
of undulation, relatively to the inflected rays which it transmits.
It may therefore be said that the breadth of the fringes, produced
by two very fine slits, is equal to the length of an undulation
supposed
<span class="xxpn" id="p135">[p135]</span>
to be multiplied by the interval between the two
slits, and divided by the distance of the screen from the wires of
the micrometer employed for measuring the fringes.</p>

<p>This formula is also applicable to the dark and bright stripes which
are observed in the shadow of a narrow substance, substituting the
breadth of this substance for the interval which separates the two
slits, as long as the stripes are far enough from the edges of the
shadow: for when they approach very near to the edges, it is shown,
both by theory and by experiment, that this calculation does not
represent the facts with sufficient accuracy; and it is not perfectly
correct in all cases, either for the fringes within the shadow, or
for those of the two slits, but only for the fringes produced by the
mirrors, which exhibit the simplest case of the interference of rays
slightly inclined to each other. In order to obtain from the theory,
a rigorous determination of the situation of the dark and light
stripes in the two former cases, it is not sufficient to calculate
the effect of two systems of undulations, but those of an infinite
number of similar groups must be combined, according to a principle
which will shortly be explained, in treating of the general theory of
diffraction.</p>

<h3 class="hleft"><em class="italic">De l’Influence des Agens Physiques sur la Vie</em>. Par W. F. Edwards,
D.M., Membre associé de l’Académie royale de Médicine de Paris,
Membre de la Société Philomatique, de la Société de Médicine de
Dublin, &#38;c. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">T<span>HE</span></span>
researches of science among the phenomena of the physical world
have long obtained a high degree of estimation and interest in
general society; but it is of late years only that their application
to living functions has attracted much of the attention of the
literary world.</p>

<p>The laws which govern the action of animal organs (the proper
department of Physiology) have usually been investigated by the
medical profession, to which they especially
<span class="xxpn" id="p138">[p138]</span>
refer. Now
we find the public take some pains, and with reason, to inform
themselves upon subjects connected with physiological knowledge. A
well-educated person, disposed to philosophical inquiries, is not
merely contented with the consciousness of living, and the common
information he derives of its means by experience, but he seeks also
to comprehend the relations subsisting between his own organisation
and the matters with which he is surrounded, and which at once
furnish him with nutrition, life, and support, and assail him with
disease and annihilation. His own instincts and observation, joined
to the more learned experience of his medical advisers, help him
through the precarious stages of life, and these may perhaps be
sufficient for all its purposes; and under this impression many will
seek to know no more of the secrets of nature.</p>

<p>But we live in an inquiring and scrutinising age, when the demand
for scientific principles is very generally urgent. All, therefore,
relating to organisation seems of equal interest with that
appertaining to what is termed the physical creation or inert matter.</p>

<p>Under this impression we have perused the book before us with great
satisfaction, and propose to present our readers with an analysis of
the valuable materials which it contains. We have some knowledge of
Dr. Edwards, a countryman domiciliated in France, and long resident
in Paris. We have confidence in his reports, and highly estimate
his philosophical skill, extensive acquirements, and accuracy of
observation, ranking him among the first physiologists of the age.</p>

<p>The work, now under consideration, contains an elaborate account
of a long series of experiments, instituted for the purpose of
ascertaining the influence of the physical agents upon animal life.
These agents comprehend the atmospheric air, water, and temperature;
the two first constituting the media in which all animals exist, and
the last influencing in common the inhabitants of both media. It
is true, this is a subject by no means new, for it has engaged the
attention of experimenters from the earliest days of science. But
Dr. Edwards has diligently and patiently sought to investigate the
subject himself, to correct previous errors, and to embody the facts
which he has accumulated into a more complete and regular system than
heretofore adopted. In this attempt he has been eminently successful,
and has effected more perhaps than all who preceded him, availing
himself, nevertheless, of the experience of former inquiries.</p>

<p>The extent of his book, and the number of the experiments
<span class="xxpn" id="p139">[p139]</span>
are indeed somewhat appalling, but his clear and distinct method of
arrangement greatly facilitates the reader’s endeavours to master the
extensive subjects of his pages. As a book of reference it should
find a place in the library of every scientific society, and no
individual devoted to philosophy should omit the possession of it.</p>

<p>The agency of the air around us, water, and heat and cold, have
often been the objects of <em class="italic">chemical</em> inquiry, from their known
great influence upon the animal economy. The changes effected by
the phenomena of animal life upon these agents have been accurately
examined, and partly reduced to a mathematical precision of
calculation.</p>

<p>Spallanzani and others have viewed the subject as it regards
physiology, but with such results as left the field open to
subsequent investigation. Dr. Edwards seems to have seized upon the
deficiencies of his predecessors, and, by going over their ground,
and extending his own inquiries, he has arrived at most interesting
and important results. These he has divided into four parts, as they
relate to the different orders of the animal creation. The first
part includes some of the lower animals, particularly tenacious of
life, and of cold blood, such as frogs, toads, and salamanders. The
second part is devoted to other animals of cold blood, and of the
vertebrated order, as fish, and those reptiles which include lizards,
snakes, and turtles. The third part refers to warm-blooded animals;
and the fourth part of the work is dedicated to the influence of the
physical agents upon the human race and vertebrated animals. To these
the author has added the discoveries of modern times, relative to
electricity on the animal economy, in an Appendix. A collection of
tables is appended to the work, exhibiting the principal series of
his experiments, as they regard the relative influence of physical
agents on the duration of life, and the phenomena resulting from
their mutual action.</p>

<p>The great importance of the four grand divisions of the work forbids
our hastily reviewing them, and we will endeavour to condense so much
of the information they contain as may forward the objects of our
analysis. Dr. Edwards thus announces the arrangement of his
<span class="nowrap">work:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Ces recherches auront donc rapport à l’air dans les conditions de
quantité, de mouvement et de repos, de densité et de raréfaction;
à l’eau liquide et à la vapeur aqueuse; à la température, dans ses
modifications de degré et de durée; à la lumière et à l’électricité.
Ces causes agissent à la fois sur l’économie animale, ordinairement
d’une manière sourde et imperceptible; et toujours
<span class="xxpn" id="p140">[p140]</span>
l’impression qu’on reçoit est le résultat de toutes ces actions
combinées.”</p>

<p>“Lors même que, par l’intensité de l’une d’elles, il nous arrive de
distinguer la cause qui nous affecte, l’observation de l’effet se
borne le plus souvent à la sensation, et les autres changemens qui
l’accompagnent nous échappent. On conçoit par la que l’observation
la plus attentive des phénomènes tels que la nature nous les
présente, ne saurait démêler dans cette combinaison d’actions
l’effet propre à chaque cause, ni reconnaître des effets qui ne
seraient pas révélés par la sensation.</p>

<p>“Il est une méthode qui règle les conditions extérieures, qui fait
varier celle dont on veut apprécier l’action, et qui fait juger,
par la correspondance entre ce changement et celui qui survient
dans l’économie, du rapport de cause et d’effet: c’est la méthode
expérimentale; c’est celle que j’ai suivie. Pour en tirer parti il
fallait, d’une part, déterminer l’intensité de la cause, d’autre
part celle de l’effet. La physique nous fournit ordinairement les
moyens de remplir la première indication.”</p></div>

<p>In the true spirit of philosophical investigation, Dr. Edwards, in
the first place, proceeds to examine the action of physical agents
upon the simplest forms, and least elaborately developed organised
beings, extending his inquiries upwards, in the scale of the animal
world, to man, the most perfect creature, and the ultimate object of
all physiological researches.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of constitution belonging to cold-blooded reptiles,
among which there is so little mutual dependance of organs, renders
these the best tests of the relative and proportionate influence
of the different agents, the intense action of which is liable to
destroy the more perfect animals; and the great development of the
nervous system in the higher orders gives them a wider and more
acute range of sensibility. It is difficult, at all times, and often
impossible, to insulate corporeal functions among the warm-blooded
classes, so as to ascertain the amount and limits of physical agency.
The four classes of vertebrated animals, or such as are furnished
with true spines, afford ample means of comparative illustrations;
and these departments have engaged the author’s attention, in order
to display the result of the action of the same agent exercising a
uniform influence upon constitutions very differently constructed.
The <em class="italic">air</em>, for example, exercises its influence uniformly upon he
four mentioned classes of vertebratæ, and their different families
are similarly exposed to the action of the atmosphere by respiration.</p>

<p>Curious and interesting as is this subject, it is singular
<span class="xxpn" id="p141">[p141]</span>
that, while it was among the first to be noticed, it has been
the latest in producing satisfactory results. Among the opposing
causes of the advancement of knowledge in this department, the
ignorance of our ancestors in <em class="italic">chemical</em> science seems to be the
principal. Without chemical aid it is perfectly useless to attempt
the investigation. The composition of the air respired must be well
understood; the different gases must be carefully examined, or the
physiological inquiry will be darkened and obscured.</p>

<p>Dr. Priestley laid the foundation of our chemical knowledge of
gases in their relation to respiration; but some time elapsed
before it was understood in what manner the air was connected with
animal organisation. Oxygen gas, one of the known constituents of
atmospheric air, was Priestley’s discovery, in its effect upon the
blood, of converting this fluid from a dark purple to a bright
crimson. Lavoisier founded a chemical theory upon this discovery
of the agency of air, which was subsequently applied by Goodwin to
physiology. The latter author demonstrated, by a series of excellent
and correct experiments, that the exclusion of atmospheric air
produces death in animals, in consequence of the dark-coloured blood
usually circulating in the veins being prevented from becoming
crimsoned. The state in which any animal may be thus placed, is known
by the term
<span class="smmaj">ASPHYXY</span>, and by which is to be understood a deficient
or suspended aërification of the blood, from whatever cause it may
proceed that the atmospheric air is prevented from access to the
blood as it circulates through the lungs.</p>

<p>The great French anatomist, Bichat, pursued this subject still
farther, and published a treatise on Asphyxy. He sought, by
numerous experiments, to determine the threefold relation of the
air to the nervous system, respiration, and the circulation; and
he arrived at this great and important conclusion, that the <span
class="smmaj">VENOUS OR DARK BLOOD CIRCULATING THROUGH THE BRAIN,
CREATES A CESSATION OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THAT ORGAN, AND THAT IN
CONSEQUENCE THE HEART LOSES ITS ACTION</span>. This discovery shows
us at once the direct cause of asphyxy in all its different degrees,
according, in effect, to the vitiated state of the blood from its
deficient or suspended aërification.</p>

<p>Le Gallois also investigated the subject of asphyxy; and he found
that, when <em class="italic">dark blood circulated through the
spinal marrow, the motions of the heart ceased</em>; and thus he not
only determined the relations of the nervous system to atmospheric
air, but also those of the respiration and the circulation, <span
class="xxpn" id="p142">[p142]</span> explaining the action of the air
upon animals physiologically.</p>

<p>In this inquiry warm-blooded animals were almost exclusively referred
to.</p>

<p>Spallanzani certainly investigated the action of the air on animals
of cold blood, but less in relation to the three grand objects of
Bichat and Le Gallois; and Spallanzani had the misfortune to live in
an age when neither chemistry nor physiology had made such advances
as the present age has produced.</p>

<p>Messrs. Humboldt and Provençal have, indeed, supplied much of this
deficiency, by their researches into the respiratory functions of
fishes. Nevertheless, the ground was still open, and our author has
justly appreciated the extent of former inquiries, and observed that
the phenomena of cold-blooded animals were too extraordinary to be
noticed lightly, and required much more extensive observation than
was previously bestowed upon them. With this impression, he proceeded
to form an estimate of the comparative influence of the air and water
upon the nervous and muscular systems of cold-blooded animals, which
the singular modifications of life among reptiles in particular
afford ample means of ascertaining.</p>

<p>We know that these animals possess the extraordinary property
of existing a considerable time after the removal of the heart,
with the free exercise of their senses and of voluntary motion,
notwithstanding the suppression of the circulation. Dr. Edwards
accordingly selected <em class="italic">salamanders</em> for his first investigations,
and removed the heart, with the bulb of the aorta. Two of these
were exposed to the free action of the air, and the other two were
submersed in water previously deprived of air by boiling; a similar
temperature being maintained in each medium. In four or five hours,
those submersed in the non-arëated water ceased to be active, unless
irritated, when they still appeared to retain voluntary power. One
died in eight, and the other in nine hours. The salamanders in air
lived from twenty to twenty-six hours and upwards. These comparisons
were frequently repeated, and upon frogs and toads, with the same
results, showing the experiments in air to be far more favourable
to their existence than with the animals submersed in the water.
Eight hours were about the maximum of the duration of life among
the animals submersed in the water, and twenty-nine among those
exposed to the air; so that, independently of respiration, the air
is thus proved to be the most proper
<span class="xxpn" id="p143">[p143]</span>
medium for the action of
their nervous and muscular systems, in their insulated state, the
respiration and the circulation of the blood being both suspended. As
a further corroboration of the superior vivifying property of the air
over simple water, when the same animals were plunged into unaërated
water during a certain time, as soon as they were, removed into the
atmosphere, they instantly revived; and their nervous and muscular
systems were acted on according as they were placed in either medium.
Dr. Edwards also confirmed the observation of Goodwin relative to
the effect produced on the colour of the blood. Properly speaking,
the asphyxy comes on the instant the air is excluded, the shades of
difference in the colour of the blood being referrible to the air
left in the lungs after cessation of respiration.</p>

<p>The next point to determine was the influence of the air upon the
same animals exercising the respiratory function, and retaining their
circulation, compared with those deprived of these functions.</p>

<p>The difference of time in the two cases developes the influence which
the general circulation of the blood, free from aërial contact,
exercises upon the nervous system.</p>

<p>To ascertain this point, an equal number of frogs, deprived of the
power to exercise their respiratory and circulating functions,
together with others left entire, were respectively plunged into
disaërated water. At times the difference in favour of the untouched
animals was twenty-four hours in favour of the duration of life.
Similar trials with toads and salamanders produced the same results.
In each case <em class="italic">asphyxy</em> came on; but the existence of the animals
which lived without the respiration and circulation was much
shortened. Thus the relative powers of life between the sole and
insulated action of the nervous system, and its action combined with
the circulation of dark blood, were estimated. The inference to be
deduced, therefore, is, that although disaërated blood furnishes
but an ephemeral sort of existence, it nevertheless exercises a
comparatively favourable influence upon the nervous and muscular
systems, since it tends to the prolongation of the action of these
animal functions.</p>

<p>Dr. Edwards next proceeds to investigate the phenomena of <em class="italic">asphyxy</em>
produced by <em class="italic">strangulation</em>, or the mechanical obstruction to the
access of air to the lungs, and consequently to the blood. The same
animals were employed. When the windpipe was rendered impervious by
ligature, the muscles of the animals seemed to be paralysed directly;
and although their motions became subsequently revived at times,
<span class="xxpn" id="p144">[p144]</span>
they never altogether recovered their perfect freedom. As a
comparative illustration, an equal number of frogs were submersed
in water, all of which died in about ten or eleven hours, while
those which were strangled lived from one to five days. Salamanders
continued active longest, and one did not cease to exist till the
eleventh day, although during this time he was in a complete state of
<em class="italic">asphyxy</em> from perfect strangulation.</p>

<p>Dumeril once found that a salamander lived a long time after
decapitation, even when the cicatrix of the wound was healed so as to
stop all access of air to the lungs.</p>

<p>In comparing the effects of strangulation with those of submersion
or drowning, it is to be supposed either that these animals exist a
limited period without the necessity of the nervous system being in
contact with atmospheric air, or that the air influences their blood
through the integuments of the body. Accordingly Dr. Edwards put this
to the test by making experiments upon <em class="italic">cutaneous respiration</em>.</p>

<p>Spallanzani found that the exposure of cold-blooded animals to the
air was attended with exudation of <em class="italic">carbon</em>, a phenomenon similar
to that of respiration. There appears, however, to be some source
of error in these experiments, for Spallanzani removed the lungs,
and this operation rendered the animal liable to the absorption of
air and loss of blood. Dr. Edwards sought to effect the same purpose
by a different and more successful measure. He also confined frogs
in vessels of atmospheric air, and fastened bladders round the head
and neck, tight enough to stop the entrance of air to the lungs. At
the expiration of two hours the air was examined in the bladder,
and it was found to contain an excess of <em class="italic">carbonic acid</em>. The same
result was obtained from salamanders. It appears, therefore, that
while air is in contact with the skin, <em class="italic">carbon</em> is given out; but
whether this be the effect of exhalation merely, or that <em class="italic">oxygen</em> is
actually absorbed, and <em class="italic">carbon</em> transpired, is a question which led
to further inquiries. Dr. Edwards, therefore, inclosed cold-blooded
animals in <em class="italic">solid substances</em>, in order to determine the influence of
dark-coloured blood, free of all external agency, in the production
of chemical changes, and to observe its sensible effect upon the
nervous system.</p>

<p>In the year 1779 three toads were confined in a box hermetically
sealed, and so deposited in the Academy of Sciences. Eighteen months
after, the box was opened, and one toad was found dead. These animals
have been found alive in blocks of coal after an imprisonment of some
years, and have
<span class="xxpn" id="p145">[p145]</span>
also been sealed up during similar periods
without perishing. Possibly some hole or crevice might have admitted
a little air. But, in Hevissant’s experiment of 79, care seems to
have been taken to obviate this suspicion.</p>

<p>Dr. Edwards, however, determined to put the question to the test.
He enclosed ten out of fifteen frogs in thick wooden boxes, and
filled the interstices with plaster, covering them over with the
same substance, the toads lying each in a central hole or bed. The
other five toads were at the same time submersed in water, and at
the expiration of eight hours they were found to be dead. In sixteen
hours more, one toad was taken from a box and found to be lively, and
was reconsigned to its prison. On the sixteenth day the toads in the
boxes were discovered alive, and thus the fact was established that
these animals can live far longer in a state of asphyxy confined in
solid substances, than when submersed in water. This was confirmed by
repeated trials on salamanders, frogs, and toads. The frogs perished
quickest.</p>

<p>Thus an extraordinary fact is established, as regarding reptiles,
since it affords an exception to the general rule that <em class="italic">all animals
require a</em>
<span class="smmaj">CONSTANT</span> <em class="italic">supply of fresh air for the maintenance of their
existence</em>.</p>

<p>Similar trials were repeated in sand, and with the same results.</p>

<p>Dr. Edwards found that although a certain quantity of air enters the
boxes and sand, yet that it is far too little to maintain life. His
conclusion, therefore, stands, that animals of the kind employed can
live longer in <em class="italic">solid substances</em> than in a limited quantity of <em class="italic">dry
air</em>.</p>

<p>It remains, however, to be considered in what manner these animals
have their lives extended beyond those exposed to the action of a
body of air. Dr. Edwards supposes the <em class="italic">moisture</em> of the sand to be
one cause, since in the dry air the animals become <em class="italic">desiccated</em>, the
cutaneous transpiration being lost in one case, and retained in the
other, by the exclusion of air. A rapid and abundant transpiration
from the body, united with deficiency of air, seems to be a greater
cause of dissolution than confinement in solid substances wherein
there is no waste by transpiration.</p>

<p>The author’s inquiries are next directed to the influence of
<em class="italic">temperature</em> upon animals of cold blood, and two and forty
experiments are practised upon this subject, from the month of July
to September following, during which period frogs were submersed
in aërated water, with a view of settling the duration of life,
acted on by varieties of temperature. The
<span class="xxpn" id="p146">[p146]</span>
continuance of
life, generally, in these experiments, varied from one to two hours
and twenty-seven minutes. The mean term of life was one hour and
thirty-seven minutes, as averaged in July, and in September one hour
and forty-five minutes, the two extremes of the seasons approximating
the effects. The duration of the frog’s existence was greatest in the
greatest depression of temperature. Thus at ten degrees the duration
of life was more than double what occurred at sixteen or seventeen
degrees, and at zero it was about triple. As the heat was increased,
the duration of life was diminished; at forty-two the frogs died, and
in the lowest temperature they lived longest.</p>

<p>It appeared that at zero the frogs did not become stiffened, but
retained their motion, and their resistance to the frozen state is
the cause of the continuance of their existence at a low temperature.
The cause of this resistance is to be found in their peculiarity of
constitution. Toads produced similar results.</p>

<p>It may be alleged that frogs naturally live in climates at from forty
to forty-two; but, it is to be observed, that they are then placed in
a situation of liberty to come to the surface of the water to respire
when they please; whereas in these experiments their respiration is
limited, from their inability to reach the surface.</p>

<p>Taking a wider range of temperature, Dr. Edwards sought to ascertain
the influence of the <em class="italic">seasons</em>. In July and September frogs were
found to live from one to two hours and twenty-seven minutes in
aërated water at fifteen and seventeen degrees. In November they
died at the end of more than double this period, under the same
temperature, and all other circumstances being similar excepting the
season. As the autumn advanced life was prolonged.</p>

<p>To what are we to ascribe the modifications of the seasons? Probably
to circumstances appertaining to the intensity of light, to
electricity, to temperature, to the pressure of the atmosphere, to
dryness and moisture, &#38;c.? Such existing causes naturally suggest
themselves. But it appears that little or no account can be rendered
as to pressure, since its variations were too trifling during the
two seasons. Moisture could not effect an influence, because the
experiments were performed in water. The motion of the air was also
obviated. Of all the suggested modifications <em class="italic">temperature</em> alone
acted, and this, as it related to the surrounding air, was rendered
ineffectual by artificial temperature. The animals, therefore,
could only be affected as to the temperature of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p147">[p147]</span>
seasons
<em class="italic">by that which preceded the experiments</em>. The modifications of the
seasons, therefore, appeared to influence the cold-blooded animals
used in the experiments in this point of view only. Accordingly we
have this remarkable result, that the animals lived twice as long in
autumn as in the summer preceding, when plunged in water of equal
temperature. The <em class="italic">seasons</em> evidently influence their constitutions,
so as to extend the duration of life independently of other causes,
that is, from summer to autumn. Dr. Edwards endeavoured to ascertain
if it proceeds from atmospheric temperature, and he found that frogs
lived in aërated water at ten degrees, during November, from five
or ten to eleven, and even to forty hours, in some instances, the
last term being about double the duration of life in water of the
same degree in summer. This proves the remarkable dependence of the
frog’s life under water, and the temperature of the month preceding.
Two curious facts are thus developed by experiments instituted at
different seasons. First, the influence of the temperature of the
water in which the animals were placed; and secondly, the influence
of the temperature of the air during certain periods preceding the
experiments, for in autumn the duration of life was about double
that of summer, and in winter he found the term to equal autumn,
the temperature of the air being in each comparative experiment
artificially raised to the same degree.</p>

<p>It appears from the foregoing experiments that frogs, toads,
and salamanders, exist in water according to its <em class="italic">lowness of
temperature</em>, and that their lives are prolonged <em class="italic">by the temperature
which precedes the experiment being lowered</em>. It then becomes a
question, what are the limits of this influence? This is to be
ascertained by observing the greatest duration of life among animals
deprived of external air by submersion in water; and noticing at
the same time all the favourable circumstances dependent on the
concurrent temperature in prolonging life among the cold-blooded
animals.</p>

<p>A point relative to the natural history of frogs first presents
itself to our notice. Spallanzani is of opinion that frogs do not
pass the winter under water, but retire in October from their native
rivers into moist sands, in which they make openings to breathe the
air through, called by the Italian fishermen <em class="italic">il respiro della ranà</em>.</p>

<p>M. Bose, and other French naturalists, found that frogs retire from
October to spring <em class="italic">into water</em>, but they give us no direct proof that
they constantly remain submersed. The presence of the observer may
alarm the frogs, and thus prevent
<span class="xxpn" id="p148">[p148]</span>
their putting their heads
above the water, so that the assertion is but a negative kind of
proof that they remain so long under the water without coming up to
respire, as some affirm. M. Bose declares he watched frogs approach
the surface at regular periods every day during the winter season.
Under the most favourable circumstances Dr. Edwards found that frogs
could not remain submersed, in winter, more than two days and a half.
Frogs are less active during winter than at the other seasons, but
they never lose their motion. Were it true, as Spallanzani thinks
it is, that they remained so long under water, it is probable that
they would become frozen in winter and die. Spallanzani derives
his opinion from what occurs with fish, forgetting that frogs are
amphibious, and live as well on land as in water; whereas fish are
limited to a watery medium, and can, therefore, furnish no example.</p>

<p>Dr. Edwards found that frogs, placed in certain quantities of aërated
and non-aërated water of an equal temperature, lived longest in the
<em class="italic">former</em>; but that the difference was not constant in its results,
being often twice as long in one case as in the other, as to the
duration of life.</p>

<p>The next inquiry regarded <em class="italic">stagnant water renewed at intervals</em>, and
in this the duration of life was prolonged beyond the term of the
last experiments, and even to eight days. During winter when the
temperature was lowest the frogs remained active, though less so than
in spring.</p>

<p>The conclusions to be drawn from these experiments are, that frogs
pass the winter <em class="italic">in an animated state in water</em>, not becoming
stiffened as in ice, and that they need not to approach the surface
of the water in order to respire, provided the water they inhabit
be <em class="italic">renewed at intervals</em>; but if the water be not renewed, or if
disaërated water be employed, the frogs perish.</p>

<p>Considering that these animals are truly amphibious, these results
are very curious; and it is interesting in a physiological point of
view, to know that frogs are able to respire the air contained in the
dense medium of water for an indefinite period, and just as easily as
they breathe the finer medium on land.</p>

<p>Respecting the action of aërated water on the skin, the conclusion
drawn seems to be correct, that it must be from <em class="italic">cutaneous</em>
absorption that the air contained in the water promoted the
continuance of life in Dr. Edward’s experiments upon this point,
since the animals were in a state of <em class="italic">asphyxy</em> regarding respiration
by the lungs; and that no
<span class="xxpn" id="p149">[p149]</span>
air entered in combination with
water was shewn from Dr. Edwards <em class="italic">never having seen water in the
lungs</em>. Therefore, unless the air acted on the blood through some
other organ, the lives of these animals would be definite and
shortened, even though the water be renewed from time to time, and
their <em class="italic">asphyxy</em> would be complete and continued. And since the skin
is the only organ in contact with the air, it is fair to conclude
that it is the medium of aërial absorption.</p>

<p>When the <em class="italic">webs</em> were examined under water, these membranes indicated
the action of air upon their blood-vessels, by the bright tint of the
blood.</p>

<p>Spallanzani imagined that frogs perish sooner in <em class="italic">running</em> than
in <em class="italic">stagnant</em> water; but Dr. Edwards having secured some of these
animals in ten feet of the Seine, whilst others were simultaneously
placed in <em class="italic">unrenewed stagnant water</em>, he found the latter did not
survive many hours, and the former lived a long time.</p>

<p>In order to fix the limits of this kind of existence, frogs were
placed in <em class="italic">renewed aërated water</em>, and with a temperature never
forced beyond ten degrees they were found to live <em class="italic">in all seasons
of the year</em>; but when the temperature was elevated from twelve to
fourteen, they died in a few hours. In running streams they lived
longest, and at twelve degrees they were thus more favourably placed
than in stagnant water, <em class="italic">at a lower temperature even</em>, and taking
the precaution to renew the water daily; and at seventeen degrees
in running water they died prematurely. Toads exhibited the same
comparative results, but they lived the longest.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that water contained in vessels is less
favourable to the lives of these animals than running streams,
although the water and the temperature were identical. Probably the
great advantage of running water is its <em class="italic">constant and unceasing
renewal</em>. The separate and comparative influence of air, water,
and temperature, being thus investigated, the combined action
of the three physical agents was next inquired into, and it is
demonstrated that frogs submersed in water are influenced by three
circumstances,—1. the presence of <em class="italic">air</em> in water; 2. the quantity of
its renewal; 3. the <em class="italic">temperature</em> of the medium. If the manners of
frogs be closely examined, they appear to live in water under very
considerable influence from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>From circumstances developed in the foregoing experiments, <em class="italic">cutaneous
respiration</em> seems to be pretty evidently indicated. A chapter is,
therefore, devoted to this subject, one that is not well known,
although pulmonary respiration is
<span class="xxpn" id="p150">[p150]</span>
generally understood. In
frogs, the function of pulmonary respiration is united with that
of deglutition, and the air enters only by the nostrils, the mouth
being closed during respiration. While the mouth remains open, the
action of deglutition is stopped, and, therefore, the animal does
not then breathe. Dr. Edwards availed himself of this circumstance
by gagging the mouth so as to keep it open, and thus prevent the
air from entering the lungs. The frogs were sufficiently exposed to
moisture and renewal of air to their bodies: the results were, that,
at twenty-four degrees, five frogs so placed died next day, and one
lived a week.</p>

<p>Dr. Edwards immersed some frogs in wet sand, and adopted an improved
method of excluding air from the lungs, and some of them lived
twenty days. Hence it evidently appears that air influences the
skin materially, and counterbalances the asphyxious state induced
by obstructing the air’s passage to the lungs. By adopting other
methods, the existence of frogs was prolonged to thirty or forty
days. It is, therefore, sufficiently proved that the blood undergoes
its necessary changes from atmospheric influence through the medium
of the skin, although in a minor degree compared with those which it
passes through from pulmonary respiration. Frogs are thus shewn to
possess a double source of respiration.</p>

<p>By substituting <em class="italic">oil</em> for water, frogs immersed in this fluid died
in a few hours, being at liberty to breath the air on its surface.
And, when plunged into oil, with the means of breathing by the lungs
arrested, they lived an equal time with frogs simultaneously placed
in water without power to respire. A comparison was instituted with
frogs in oil and in water, being allowed to breathe air, when the
difference was found to be very considerable in favour of the aquatic
bath. These circumstances shew, that, even with the feeble succour of
the air through the skin, absorbed from the water, the respiratory
function was far more prolonged, than in the case of the obstruction
afforded by the oil. Thus we have abundant evidence of the double
function by which frogs are maintained, from the action of the air on
the skin and the lungs; and this appears to be the means of existence
among <em class="italic">amphibious animals generally</em>.</p>

<p>It may be asked why these animals die in deep water when prevented
from approaching the surface? It appears that, having expelled the
respired air from their lungs, which is imperfectly renewed from the
water, they become specifically heavier than the water, and unable to
rise from the bottom; and thus placed, the duration of their lives
depends upon
<span class="xxpn" id="p151">[p151]</span>
the resistance offered by their constitutions
to the depressing effects of a state of asphyxy while remaining
submersed.</p>

<p>Dr. Edwards next proceeds to inquire into the effects of
<span class="smmaj">TRANSPIRATION</span>. A liquid transfusion from the skin of animals is
constantly going on, either in the form of vapour or of fluid in a
denser state.</p>

<p>The latter constitutes sweat. This phenomenon exhibits great
variations, and it is important to know what diminution of weight the
body suffers in different circumstances. In the course of an hour
remarkable fluctuations occur.</p>

<p>Dr. Edwards suspended frogs, toads, and salamanders, in a <em class="italic">calm air</em>,
weighed them, and noted the results, which, though very changeable
in an hour, were generally uniform in three, and in nine hours they
averaged an equal result. The successive diminution in the mass of
fluids was evident.</p>

<p>The results were modified by the alternate position of the animals in
a body of air in repose, or agitated by a draft. And these results do
not appear to depend upon any principle of vitality, for they take
place equally in death and in life, and indeed among unorganized
bodies, as, for example, lumps of charcoal soaked in water. Therefore
the cause of the phenomenon of transpiration seems to be referrible
entirely to physical agents. The <em class="italic">motion of the air</em> seems to be its
exciting cause; for even when, to all appearance, it is calm, it is
in reality agitated more or less, and produces a sensible evaporation
from the skin. But the difference between the effect of calm and
agitated air is remarkable; for in a draft, the animals exposed to
it sweated away double the quantity of liquid compared with those
confined in a room shut up. The amount lost was proportioned to the
<em class="italic">intensity of the wind</em>, and reached a triple amount over those
animals in stagnant air; and this fact explains the variations
noticed from hour to hour among animals exposed to currents of air.</p>

<p>The transpiration which occurs in very moist air, always amounts to a
diminution of weight; but in dry air it is five or ten times greater;
and when the influence of a moist state of the atmosphere is compared
with that of a dry state, the amount of evaporation is equal to that
of a dry and calm air.</p>

<p>Transpiration may, therefore, be referred to <em class="italic">the agitation of the
atmosphere</em> for its exciting cause, beyond any modifications of its
<em class="italic">density</em>. And, although an elevated temperature be favourable to
transpiration, its modifying influence is less than that of other
causes.</p>

<p>In comparing the effects of <em class="italic">absorption</em> and <em class="italic">transpiration</em>,
<span class="xxpn" id="p152">[p152]</span>
in water and in air, frogs were found to gain an addition to their
weight according to the term of their continuance in the former
medium. An absorption of water was rendered evident by the loss of
bulk it had sustained, when measured after the experiment.</p>

<p>Thus, when the comparative influence of water and air is estimated,
the former appears to be absorbed, and adds to the weight of the
body; and the latter tends to diminish the weight, by different and
fluctuating degrees of evaporation taking place, and dependent much
more on the degree of motion in the air, than on its dryness or
humidity: these last conditions modify evaporation in a minor degree,
when compared with the influence of a current of air.</p>

<p>The celerity of <em class="italic">absorption</em> exceeds that of <em class="italic">transpiration</em> six
times, in the most rapid cases. It therefore results, that the losses
by <em class="italic">transpiration</em> in air should be repaid by absorption of water
in a much less time than the expenditure occurs. But the decrease
of weight is not prolonged; it is sudden, and not continuous,
alternating with augmentation of weight, by absorption of liquid
going on in a ratio superior to the loss; and thus nature’s provision
is manifested for the nutriment of the body.</p>

<p>With this last inquiry Dr. Edwards concludes the first part of
his work; and it is observed, that, with regard to transpiration,
the losses of weight have been considered without reference to
the existence of any other influence than water. The losses by
transpiration have been examined generally without regard to the
matters lost. What relates to water differs essentially in one
respect from that which regards the air. The losses sustained by the
body ought to be more particularly examined. Temperature and loss of
time require estimation. An excretion of <em class="italic">solid</em> matter evidently
takes place; for the water, in which animals are submersed, becomes
turbid, especially in hot weather, and it sensibly contains animal
matters, affecting the weight of the body in water.</p>

<p>When animals are submersed in water, their skins exercise two
functions, acting inversely in determining their weight. And it
results, from comparative experiments, that the <em class="italic">absorption at
zero</em> exceeds the <em class="italic">loss in water</em>; while at thirty degrees the
<em class="italic">loss</em> exceeds the increase by weight from absorption; and the
higher the temperature, the greater is the excess in the discharge
of animal matters. We may therefore presume, that the agency of
<em class="italic">temperature</em> produces analogous effects, upon aërial transpiration,
to those before observed
<span class="xxpn" id="p153">[p153]</span>
in other inquiries; and the effects
of <em class="italic">dryness</em> and <em class="italic">moisture</em> in the air produce a minor degree of
influence also, when compared with <em class="italic">temperature</em>, on the losses of
animal substances.</p>

<p>We have been thus minute in our analysis, because the subject of
it is new to science in its present shape, and of a high degree of
interest. Dr. Edwards’s researches among the different classes of
animals have tended more to the illustration of the influence of
physical agents upon life than any previous authorities; and the
persevering industry, accuracy of observation, and patient inquiry
which he has evinced in his investigations among cold-blooded
animals, have placed this department of the creation in a point of
view at once curious, interesting, and valuable to science. We attach
the greater importance to this part of the author’s work, as it is
a ground on which he may be consulted, and quoted as indisputable
authority, until equal inquiries have shewn him to be fallacious.</p>

<p>Our limits will not at present permit us to proceed farther in our
analysis, and we must refer the remainder of the book to a future
opportunity. The subjects of the three other parts, though greatly
extended, will not probably require such minute analysis as those
novel experiments which form the subject of the first part; but we
imagine that the application of the principles laid down, in the
previous inquiries, to human physiology, will be found not less
interesting than those which relate to the natural history of the
lower orders of the animal creation.</p>

<h3 class="h3center"><em class="italic">An Account of Professor
Carlini’s Pendulum Experiments on Mont Cenis</em>. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">W<span>E</span></span>
believe that no account of Professor Carlini’s pendulum
experiments on Mont Cenis has hitherto appeared in the periodical
scientific publications of this country: the experiments are,
however, well deserving of such notice, having been conducted with
great care, and having had a specific object in view, which object
seems to have been satisfactorily accomplished. The following
brief account of them, taken from the original memoir published in
the Appendix to the “Ephéméride di Milano” for 1824, may not be
unacceptable to those of our readers who interest themselves in
subjects of this class.</p>

<p>The length of the simple pendulum vibrating seconds is a
<span class="xxpn" id="p154">[p154]</span>
measure of the intensity of gravitation; <em class="italic">i. e.</em> of the excess of the
force of gravity over the centrifugal force. In consequence of the
ellipticity of the earth, and of the difference in the direction of
the two forces, the intensity of gravitation varies according to the
different latitudes. It also varies, in the same latitude, according
to the greater or less elevation of the pendulum above the level of
the sea; <em class="italic">i. e.</em> according to its greater or less distance from the
centre of the attracting force.</p>

<p>Had the earth a perfectly level surface, such, for instance, as
it would have if it were everywhere covered by a fluid, the force
of gravity, in receding from the surface, would diminish in the
duplicate proportion of the distance from the earth’s centre. In the
actual state of the globe, however, its continents and its islands
are raised above the general level of the sea by which it is only
partially covered; and if a pendulum be raised, on the surface of
the land, to a known elevation above the sea, the diminution of
gravity will not be, as in the more simple case, proportioned to the
squares of the respective distances from the earth’s centre, but that
proportion will require to be modified, by taking into account the
attraction of the elevated materials, interposed between the general
surface and the place of observation.</p>

<p>When pendulums are employed in different latitudes, to obtain the
ratio of gravitation between the equator and the pole, for the
purpose of deducing the ellipticity of the earth, all the places
of observation, being on land, are more or less elevated above the
sea; inland stations, in particular, are sometimes at considerable
elevations: to render these results comparable one with another,
it is necessary to reduce each result to what it would have been,
had it been made at some level common to all the experiments; and
the surface of the sea has hitherto been taken as that common
level. Previous to the publication of a paper of Dr. Young’s in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1819, the consideration which we have
mentioned, that of the attraction of the matter interposed between
the place of observation and the level of the sea, was generally
unheeded in estimating the allowance to be made for the reduction
of different heights to the common level: in that paper, however,
Dr. Young took occasion to point out the probable effect of
<span class="xxpn" id="p155">[p155]</span>
the interposed matter in modifying considerably the usual allowance;
that, supposing its density to be about half the mean density of
the earth, the effect of an hemispherical hill of such matter, on
the summit of which the pendulum should be placed, would be to
diminish the correction, deduced from the duplicate proportion from
the earth’s centre, about
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">5</span></span>;</span>
that, in like manner, a tract of
table-land, considered as an extensive flat surface, of the same
relative density, would diminish the correction about
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>;</span>
and that, accordingly, in almost any country that could be chosen for
the experiment, the proper correction for the height would vary,
according to the form and density of the interposed materials, from
rather more than a half to rather less than three-quarters of the
usual allowance. This view has been subsequently acted upon by the
English pendulum experimentors, in reducing their observations;
but it has not been yet adopted by the French. The experiments of
Professor Carlini were calculated to afford a practical illustration
of the correctness of Dr. Young’s reasoning.</p>

<p>Professor Carlini was engaged, in the summer of 1821, in concert
with Professor Plana, in determining the amplitude of the celestial
arc between the Hospice on Mont Cenis and the Observatory at Milan,
by means of fire-signals made on the Roche Melon, and observed
simultaneously at Milan and at a temporary observatory established
at the Hospice. Whilst thus engaged, Professor Carlini, being
stationary for several days on Mont Cenis, and obliged to have time
very accurately determined, for the purpose of comparing with the
observatory at Milan, availed himself of the opportunity to employ
a pendulum apparatus of the same general nature as that used by M.
Biot at Paris, which had been prepared at Milan some years before,
under the direction of a commission of weights and measures, with the
view of determining the value of the divisions of the national linear
scale. As this apparatus differed in some few particulars from the
original employed in France, we shall briefly notice the differences,
presuming our readers to be acquainted with the apparatus of <span class="allcaps">MM</span>.
Borda and Biot.</p>

<p>1. In the Milan apparatus, by means of two microscopes furnished with
wire micrometers, the length of the pendulum
<span class="xxpn" id="p156">[p156]</span>
may be measured
without touching it; without approaching it; without even opening the
case which contains it. The measure is obtained by bringing the wires
in contact with the images of the knife-edge suspension, and of the
upper and lower borders alternately of the platinum disk suspended to
the thread: thus preventing the risk of deranging the equilibrium,
and avoiding the effect which the heat of the body might have on the
dilatable metallic thread.</p>

<p>2. The half sum of the distances taken between the suspension, and
the upper and lower edges of the disk, gives the distance of the
centre of the disk itself; without measuring its diameter with a
compass, an operation exceedingly difficult to execute with the
necessary precision. By this apparatus of microscopes the length may
be measured at pleasure, even during the time of oscillation; and
being attached to the wall, instead of supported by the floor, the
risk of derangement by the tread of the observer is avoided.</p>

<p>3. The pendulum, and the clock by which its oscillations are
measured, were not, as usually, near together and resting on the
same base, but were perfectly separated. The coincidences of the
oscillations were observed, by bringing the image of the pendulum of
the clock, reflected by means of an oblique mirror, in contact with
the image of the simple pendulum seen direct through a telescope. By
this modification the risk of the mutual influence of the pendulum
and the clock is avoided.</p>

<p>4. The disk was attached to the thread by means of knots in the
thread itself; avoiding the correction for the small cup usually
employed for that purpose.</p>

<p>5. An alteration was made in the weight and shape of the knife-edge
suspension; reducing its weight to about 10 grains, and giving it the
shape of a rotella, instead of that of a triangular prism.</p>

<p>The simple pendulum and microscopes were attached to a strong
wall, in a room on the ground floor, contiguous to the temporary
observatory, and well sheltered from the sun and weather. The clock
with which the pendulum was compared, was supported by a pyramid of
masonry resting on the ground, and occupying the middle of the room.
The experimental length between the microscopes was referred to three
standard metres,
<span class="xxpn" id="p157">[p157]</span>
in perfect agreement with each other: one
received from Paris by the Commission of Weights and Measures at
Milan; a second brought more recently from Paris by Conte Moscati;
and a third in the possession of the Royal Academy of Turin.</p>

<p>The experiments were commenced on the 3rd of September, and
terminated on the 27th, being interrupted by M. Carlini’s absence
at Chambery from the 7th to the 12th. The distance between the
microscopes, and the oscillations and length of the pendulum,
were measured alternately. Thirteen independent results were thus
obtained, of which the greatest discordance from the mean was not
more than
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">13</span><span class="fdn">10000</span></span>ths</span>
of a British inch. The mean result was 39.0992
British inches, the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in a
vacuum, at the place of observation on Mont Cenis, 1943 metres, or
6374 feet above the sea, in the latitude of
<span class="nowrap">45° 14′ 10″.</span> To compare
with this determination, we may obtain a tolerably fair approximation
to the pendulum at the level of the sea in the latitude of
<span class="nowrap">45° 14′ 10″,</span>
such as its length might have been found, if the mountain could
have been removed and the pendulum placed on its site, by deduction
from the lengths actually measured with a similar apparatus, on the
arc between Formentera and Dunkirk, at stations not far removed from
the level of the sea, in the adjacent parallels to Mont Cenis, and in
the countries adjoining. Of these there are five, not including the
station at Clermont, in consequence of its great elevation: they are
as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<p>The mean length of the seconds pendulum at the level of the sea, in
the latitude of <span class="nowrap">45° 14′ 10″,</span> deduced from these determinations, is
39.1154; and it is so equally, whether an ellipticity of
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">288</span></span>th,</span>
or of
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">304</span></span>th,</span>
or any intermediate ellipticity, be assumed in the
reduction.</p>

<p>We have, then, <span class="nowrap">39.1154−39.0992&#160;=</span> ·0162 inch., as the
<span class="xxpn" id="p158">[p158]</span>
measure
of the difference in the intensity of gravitation at the place of
observation elevated 1943 metres; and at the level of the sea. The
radius of the earth, being 6,376,478 metres, this measure, according
to the duplicate proportion of the distances from the earth’s centre,
should be ·0238 inch. The attraction of the mountain is, then,
equal to <span class="nowrap">·0238−·0162&#160;=</span> ·0076 inch. Whence it appears that, in this
particular instance, the correction for the elevation is reduced,
by the attraction of the interposed matter,
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">68</span><span class="fdn">100</span></span>ths,</span>
or to about
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">7</span><span class="fdn">10</span></span>ths</span>
of the amount immediately deducible from the squares of the
distances.</p>

<p>It is obvious that, if we possessed a correct knowledge of the
density and arrangement of the materials of which Mont Cenis is
composed, so as to enable a computation of the sum of all the
attractions which they exercise on the place of observation, this
result might furnish, as well as Dr. Maskelyne’s experiments on the
deviation of the plumb-line produced by the attraction of Mount
Schehallien, a certain determination of the mean density of the
earth. Professor Carlini considers that the form of the eminence may
be sufficiently represented by a segment of a sphere, a geographical
mile in height, having as its base a circle of 11 miles diameter,
the distance from Susa to Lansleburgo; the attractive force, on
a point placed on the summit, would, in such case, be equal to
<span class="nowrap">2&#8201;π&#8201;δ&#8201;(1−<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span><span class="fdn">3</span></span>&#8201;√<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">11</span></span>)</span>
or in numbers to
<span class="nowrap">5·020&#8201;δ,</span>
δ being the
density of the mountain, and 2&#8201;π the ratio of the circumference to
radius. The attractive force of the earth, on a point at its surface, is
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">4</span><span class="fdn">3</span></span>&#8201;π&#8201;r&#8201;Δ,&#160;=</span>
<span class="nowrap">14394&#8201;Δ,</span>
<em class="italic">r</em> being the radius of the earth&#160;= 3437
geographical miles, and Δ its mean density. Now these two quantities,
<span class="nowrap">14394&#8201;Δ</span> and
<span class="nowrap">5·020&#8201;δ,</span>
should be, to each other, in the proportion
of 39.1154,—the pendulum at the level of the sea, representing
gravitation at the surface of the earth,—to
<span class="nowrap">·0076,</span> the portion of
gravitation at the summit of the mountain due to the attraction
of the mountain. By the observations of M. de Saussure and other
geologists, Mont Cenis is chiefly composed of schistus, marble, and
gypsum; the specific gravities of which substances were ascertained,
from numerous specimens in the possession of M. Carlini, to be
respectively as follows:—
<span class="xxpn" id="p159">[p159]</span></p>

<div class="tablebox pbinsideavoid">

<tr>
 <td>The marble</td>
 <td>2·86.</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td>The gypsum</td>
 <td>2.32.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In the absence of a precise knowledge of the quantity and position
or each of these three component parts, we may take the mean, 2.66,
of their several densities as approximatively the density of the
mountain,&#160;= δ. We have then</p>

<div class="tablebox">
<p class="center bigfract">Δ&#160;=

4.77,</p></div>

<p class="continue">a result differing little from that of Cavendish as recently
corrected by Dr. Hutton, and still less from that of the Schehallien
experiments.</p>

<p>The most hypothetical element of this calculation is the width
assigned to the base of the mountain; but by the very nature of the
question, it has but little influence on the final result; since,
by even doubling the assigned diameter, the total attraction would
not be altered a twentieth. In regard to the mean density of the
mountain, if it were taken at 2.75, instead of 2.66, that of the
earth would result 4.94, instead of 4.77, as given above.</p>

<h4>I. <em class="italic">Observations upon the Growth of Early and Late Grapes under
Glass</em>. By Mr. James Acon. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h4>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">F<span>EW</span></span>
gardens are to be found in which bunches of fresh ripe grapes can
be gathered every day in the year: notwithstanding the importance
of the fruit to the luxurious, and the facility with which the vine
submits to the artificial climate of the forcing-house. Nothing is
easier than to secure crops of grapes in a vinery during the spring
and summer months; but it is far more difficult to obtain them in
the last and earliest seasons of the year, when the plants would
<span class="xxpn" id="p160">[p160]</span>
naturally be in state of torpidity. It is well known that
this desirable purpose is attained in great perfection in the garden
of the Earl of Surrey, at Worksop Manor; and the management there
practised is the subject of this paper.</p>

<p>The common methods of forcing early grapes are to train the vines
under the roof near the glass, or on small frames against flued
walls; but to both these practices Mr. Acon finds great objections:
to the former because it renders the house too dark, and exposes
the young and tender branches to the pernicious effect of blasts of
cold air rushing through the interstices of the panes; and to the
latter, because the heat of the flues is apt to scorch the branches,
and in consequence to destroy the crop,—excessive heat in the one
case producing the same injurious effects as excessive cold in the
other. The following are the two modes by which Mr. Acon obtains his
<em class="italic">very early</em> and his <em class="italic">very late</em> grapes. For the early crops a house
is used, of which the back wall is 9.6 feet in height, and the front
wall 3 feet, the roof forming an angle of about 30 degrees. It is
heated, from the absolute necessity of employing an atmosphere of
unusually high temperature, with two flues that pass along the middle
of the house, and return in the back wall; a fire-place being built
at each end of the house. Forcing begins on the first of September,
and the fruit begins to ripen the first week in March. The vines
are trained upon a trellis, fixed over the flues, in the centre of
the house, and also upon the back wall; but none are allowed to
obstruct the light by occupying the roof, until about six weeks after
the forcing has commenced, when some new shoots are introduced and
trained to the rafters. The form of this house gives it a peculiar
advantage, in presenting a greater surface for the growth of vines
than can be derived from any other plan; the trellis which is placed
over the flues is nearly equal to the whole roof, without being in
any degree injurious to the plants trained upon the back wall. The
vines are planted in the inside of the house, but in such a manner
that the mould in which they grow is not heated by the fire-places
of either flue. The usual mode of exposing the main stem of a forced
vine to an extremely low temperature in the external air, while the
branches are stimulated by a very high temperature in an entirely
different atmosphere, is very properly objected to. Nothing, in
fact, can be more injudicious than such a practice, in cases where
very early forcing is required; for it should be borne in mind,
that although the absorption of the elements by which the proper
juices of a
<span class="xxpn" id="p161">[p161]</span>
plant are elaborated, and brought into the state
under which they appear in the fruit, and in the secretions of the
plant, is carried on by the leaves alone, yet that all these juices
have, in the first instance, to pass along the vessels of the stem
before they reach the leaves; and that the whole of the bark of a
tree is, rightly considered, a leaf of a particular description,
formed of the same kind of tissue, and exercising the same functions,
and undoubtedly producing a powerful effect upon the motion of the
fluids of the branches, with the vessels of which it is elaborately
and intimately entangled, from the core to the circumference. No
argument can be necessary to show that an equal action of the vessels
of a plant is indispensable to the due maintenance of the vegetable
functions in a healthy state, and that this is not to be maintained
by exposing the main stem and the extremities to an atmosphere and
temperature entirely different. Such irregularities do not exist in
free Nature, and she will not submit to them when in fetters.</p>

<p>In pruning vines for early forcing, as little wood should be employed
as possible. Mr. Acon stops the shoots one joint above each cluster,
and has no joint without a bunch. When the crop is over, and the wood
perfectly matured, the branches should be laid near the ground, and
shaded till the recommencement of forcing. In short, they should be
placed in a condition as nearly as possible resembling the gloom and
cold of winter. If this process be well managed, the vines will alter
their natural habits, and instead of budding with the spring, their
vegetation will naturally commence at the period at which they have
been accustomed to be stimulated.</p>

<p>For late grapes, a house of a different construction is employed.
The back wall is 12 feet high, the front wall
<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
foot, and the
roof lies at an angle of 45 degrees. The heat is supplied by a single
flue passing along the middle of the house. The sorts best adapted
for late forcing are the Muscat of Alexandria, the St. Peter’s, and
the Black Damascus; all other kinds wither prematurely. This house
is generally shut about the middle or end of May, as soon as the
bunches become visible. The vines are trained on a trellis near the
glass. Till they are out of blossom the air is kept very warm, a
point to which much importance attaches, because it is during this
period that all the branches that are to bear fruit in the succeeding
season are produced. In a high temperature, the branches will grow
more compactly, and
<span class="xxpn" id="p162">[p162]</span>
will be more regularly matured than in
a low temperature, in which the wood is apt to become excessively
luxuriant, and not to ripen well. Great attention must be paid to
this point. As much air as possible is introduced into the vinery
during the summer; but as the autumn advances, more caution in this
respect is observed. The fruit should be perfectly coloured at the
approach of the dark season; for if the colouring be deferred too
long, the berries will never acquire their proper flavour. Great
care must be observed to remove daily such berries as are inclining
to damp, or the whole crop will soon be spoiled. This should be
particularly attended to; for the contagion of what gardeners call
<em class="italic">damp</em>, arises from the growth of minute fungi which vegetate upon
the epidermis, and spread during the autumn with alarming rapidity
from bunch to bunch.</p>

<p>The pruning of vines for late forcing is the same as has been already
explained. When the crop is gathered, the house is unroofed for a
short time, in order to expose the branches to a low temperature,
and to the degree of humidity necessary to replenish their vessels,
which have been drained by the dryness of the climate in which, when
forced, they were necessarily kept.</p>

<p>By the means above described, a regular supply of grapes is secured
through the year. The late-house crop lasts from the middle of
January to the end of March; it is succeeded by the first crop in
the early-house, which carries on the supply into May, and it is
continued by the grapes on the rafters in the same house until the
vines in the pine stoves, which are forced early in January and
February, produce their crops. These continue bearing through the
summer, when a vinery, of which the forcing commences about the end
of March, furnishes the supply till the late-house fruit is ready in

<h4><span class="allcaps">II</span>. <em class="italic">On the Varieties of Cardoon, and the Methods of cultivating them</em>.
By Mr. A. Mathews. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h4>

<p class="first">Who
does not wish to read of the cardoon; of that prince of
vegetables, whose praises have been sung or said by all cooks and
gourmands, from the fastidious Périgords and Cardellis of the French
<em class="italic">cuisine</em>, down to the more homely Rundells and Glasses of our
English kitchens; whose virtues are so marvellous as to be credible
upon no less authority
<span class="xxpn" id="p163">[p163]</span>
than that of the sage gastrophilists
aforesaid. To restore unwonted vigour to old age, and new elasticity
to youth, are the most modest of its attributes; the magical broth
with which the veins of Æson were replenished by the cunning Medea,
was doubtless prepared from the cardoon; and the story itself is
probably a sort of figurative record of the skill of the fair
enchantress in cooking this delicious vegetable, which was well
known to the Grecian gastronomes under the name of κακτος;
but this we throw out merely as a suggestion. Upon preparing herbs
thus potent for the table, cookery has exhausted all its skill; to
dress a cardoon is declared, by the highest authority in the art, to
be the surest test of a skilful cook; and one of those invaluable
acquirements which, to borrow the words of a writer not less
celebrated for his powers of composition than of cooking, “raises
cookery to the rank of the <em class="italic">sciences</em>, and its <em class="italic">professors</em> to the
title of artists.” Our good forefathers, indeed, “could not find the
true manner of dressing cardoons,” and were content to eat them raw
“with vinegar and oyl, pepper and salt, all of them, or some, as
every one liketh for their delight;” which, considering that this
vegetable is both bitter and astringent in a high degree, does not
argue much for the delicacy of palate of our ancestors; little did
they dream of the savoury preparations that modern art has devised by
the aid of Espagnole, consommé, blancs, tammies, marking, masking,
and all the mysteries of the stew-pan.</p>

<p>Four varieties are here described, of which the Spanish cardoon is
the most common, and the cardon de Tours the best.</p>

<p>They are cultivated, like celery, in deep broad trenches, well
manured and watered. When the plants are nearly full-grown, which
will be about the end of October, a dry day is to be chosen for
performing the operation of blanching them, which is thus
<span class="nowrap">effected:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="clearfix">“The leaves of each plant are carefully and lightly tied together
with strong matting, keeping the whole upright, and the ribs of
the leaves together. The plant is then bound closely round with
twisted haybands, about an inch and a half in diameter, beginning
at the root, and continuing to about two-thirds of its height. If
the plants are intended for winter store, they must be earthed up
like celery; but if to be consumed before the frosts set in, the
operation of earthing up may be omitted.”

<em class="italic">Accounts and Descriptions of the several Plants belonging to
the genus Hoya, which are cultivated in the garden of the
Horticultural Society at Chiswick</em>. By Mr. James Traill. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h4>

<p class="first">The
beauty of one species of Hoya, viz., H. <em
class="italic">carnosa</em>, has long caused it to be a favourite
with collectors. The object of the writer of this paper is to call
attention to such others as are known to exist in gardens, or as are
preserved in the records of the botanist.</p>

<p>The following species form the subject of the paper, viz.:</p>

<ul class="inlinepadded">
<li>1&#160;Hoya carnosa, <em class="italic">R. Brown</em>.</li>
<li>2&#160;Hoya crassifolia, <em class="italic">Haworth</em>.</li>

<li>4&#160;Hoya Pottsii, (Tab. I.)</li>
<li>5&#160;Hoya trinervis.</li>
</ul>

<p>These five are all the species at present cultivated in gardens;
others are known to exist in the warmer regions of Asia, where they
should be assiduously sought for by travellers, as they are not only
very ornamental, but easily to be transported to Europe.</p>

<p>From such materials as he has been able to procure, the writer
enumerates the following as completing the genus Hoya, as far as at
present ascertained:</p>

<ul class="inlinepadded">
<li>6&#160;Hoya chinensis.</li>

<h4><span class="allcaps">IV</span>. <em class="italic">On acclimatizing Plants at Biel, in East Lothian</em>. By Mr. John
Street, gardener to the Honourable Mrs. Hamilton Nesbitt. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h4>

<p class="first">Perhaps
there is no point whatever, connected with Horticulture, of
greater interest than that which forms the subject of this paper;
it is the distant goal towards which we all are striving, but of
which, alas! we have not as yet even caught a glimpse. The gardener
is in possession of the powers by which he can bend the seasons to
his will; he can dispel the frozen gloom of winter with the rich
warm glow of the vintage; at his call the flowers of spring and
summer start up beneath his feet, and his hothouses are filled with
the luscious fruits of the torrid zone. All this he knows how to
effect with an artificial climate; but he has no influence over the
natural climate of his country, nor can he impart to the vegetation
of warmer latitudes the least additional power of resisting cold, for
which they have not been prepared by nature. Acclimatizing is still
a secret to be discovered. To
<span class="xxpn" id="p165">[p165]</span>
this day not a single instance
can be adduced of any exotic plant whatever possessing greater powers
of withstanding cold, than it had when first introduced. It has
been hoped that if the seeds of given plant could be procured, for
many generations, in a climate severer than its own, the offspring
so obtained would gradually accommodate themselves to their new
country; but no such result has followed from the experiments that
have been tried. Let us take a few familiar examples:—the common
nasturtium, (Tropælum majus,) a native of Peru, is said to have been
introduced about the year 1686. At the time at which we are writing,
it must have descended through about 140 generations; and yet it has
not become in the smallest degree capable of resisting cold. Of the
mignonette (Reseda odorata), the date of introduction is not well
ascertained; it has probably been a favourite border annual for sixty
or seventy years, and yet it has in no degree shaken off its annual
character, which is unnatural to it, and resumed the suffrutescent
habit which it possesses in its own milder climate. The potato,
too, which has for two centuries and a half been increased in every
conceivable manner, by seeds as well as by offsets, bears cold in
no degree more readily than it did in the sixteenth century. Nor
does it appear to us probable, that acclimatizing, if practicable,
is to be brought about by sowing seeds in northern latitudes
through successive generations. We do not believe that plants will
bear their seeds at all in a temperature much lower than that in
which they have been located by the hand of Nature. The heat of a
northern summer sufficiently approximates to that of the tropics,
to be considered, with reference to vegetation, as the same, and
it is during that season that the seeds of all plants are ripened;
the conditions, therefore, under which the seeds of Tropæolum, for
example, are produced in England, do not materially differ from those
under which the same seeds are produced in Peru; if the season proves
unpropitious in any considerable degree, they are not produced at
all. How then can it be expected that seeds ripened under similar
circumstances, but in different latitudes, should give birth to a
progeny differing in any remarkable particular from their parents?
In fact, in power of resisting cold, they do not differ at all. If
such a capability were to obtained, it would be by inducing plants to
ripen their seeds in winter.</p>

<p>But if it is certain that nothing is to be gained in acclimatizing,
by raising plants from seed through successive generations,
<span class="xxpn" id="p166">[p166]</span>
it is no less true that many trees, which have been supposed to be
incapable of surviving a northern winter, are now ascertained to be
perfectly hardy, and that the power of enduring cold may be increased
in others, by a judicious management of soil and situation.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of vegetable life being destroyed by cold, probably
arises from the vessels, through which the circulation and secretion
of the fluids of plants take place, being ruptured by the expansion,
from cold, of the fluid they contain. In proportion, therefore,
to the tenuity of the vessels, and the abundance of their fluid,
will be the danger to which they are exposed from frost; and to the
strength of the vessels, and the paucity of their fluid, the power
of resisting cold. Thus vigorous shoots of the oak, walnut, and many
other trees, which are formed with rapidity, imperfectly matured,
and highly charged with fluid, are extremely impatient of cold, and
are even destroyed by a few degrees of frost; while the twigs and
branches of the same trees, which are formed slowly, fully matured,
and incompletely filled with fluid, bear unharmed the utmost rigour
of our winters. In acclimatizing, therefore, this law should be
carefully remembered, and the situations in which tender plants are
stationed, should be those in which their growth is restrained, and
an excessive absorption of fluid prevented.</p>

<p>This appears to have been the true secret of the success that has
attended the attempts at acclimatizing, which form the subject of
Mr. Street’s communication. By planting in situations well drained
from superfluous moisture, under circumstances where rapid growth
was rendered impracticable, and, as we understand, in a garden
admirably adapted to the object, from its position, he has succeeded
in naturalizing, in latitude <span class="nowrap">56° N.,</span> plants which have not yet been
known to endure the winters even of the parallel of London.</p>

<h4>V. <em class="italic">Upon the Culture of Celery</em>. By Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq.,
F.R.S., President. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h4>

<p class="first">“That which can be very easily done, without the exertion of much
skill or ingenuity, is,” Mr. Knight observes, “very rarely found
to be well done, the excitement to excellence being in such cases
necessarily very feeble.” This remark is in the present case applied
to the cultivation of celery, which, being a native of the sides
of wet ditches, might naturally be expected to demand an abundant
supply of water when cultivated. Accordingly, Mr. Knight found that
by keeping the ground, in which celery was planted,
<span class="xxpn" id="p167">[p167]</span>
constantly
wet, it grew by the middle of September to the height of five feet,
and its quality was in proportion to its size. Mr. Knight also
recommends planting at greater distances than is usually the case,
and covering the beds, into which the young seedlings are first
removed, with half-rotten dung, overspread to the depth of about two
inches with mould; under which circumstances, whenever the plants are
removed, the dung will adhere tenaciously to their roots, and it will
not be necessary to deprive the plants of any part of their leaves.</p>

<p class="first">In order to protect the fruit upon walls from the ravages of bees,
wasps, flies, and other winged enemies, a frame is contrived fitting
close to the face of the wall, and having a moveable sliding canvass
front, which can be readily removed when the fruit is to be gathered,
and replaced again afterwards. A plan of the frame accompanies the
paper. From what we have seen of this contrivance, we know that it is
well adapted to its purpose, and that no garden in which fine fruit
is required, should be without one or more of such frames. For the
mode of making them, we must refer to the paper itself.</p>

By Mr. Andrew Mathews. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h4>

<p class="first">In this country, the egg-plant, brinjal, or aubergine, is chiefly
cultivated as a curiosity; but in warmer climates, where its growth
is attended with less trouble, it is a favourite article of the
kitchen-garden. In the form of fritters, or farces, or in soups, it
is frequently brought to table in all the southern parts of Europe;
and forms a pleasant
<span class="xxpn" id="p168">[p168]</span>
variety of esculent. This paper describes
the only two kinds that are worth cultivation in England.</p>

Minute Books and Papers of the Society</em>. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h4>

<p class="first">A novel kind of pine pit is described, which is said to answer every
purpose that can be desired. It is heated by flues passing through a
chamber, formed by beams extending from the back to the front wall,
and so becoming a sort of floor, upon which is first placed a layer
of turf; and then the tan in which the pine-plants are plunged. The
warmer air is conveyed into the upper part of the pit by means of
small apertures contrived in the walls, at four inches and a half
apart, both in the back and front of the pit, and also through
iron pipes resting on the beams and passing through the tan. The
ventilation is effected by air-holes in the front wall, and sliding
shutters in the back walls. An explanatory figure accompanies the
statement.</p>

<p>The famous rhubarb, which has of late acquired so much celebrity
under the name of Buck’s rhubarb, is mentioned as excellent when
forced. It is not generally known, that this sort is the genuine
Rheum undulatum of botanists uncontaminated by mixture with the
common garden kinds. The plant generally called Rheum undulatum, is
a half-bred, possessing none of the good qualities of the native
species.</p>

<p>George Tollet, Esq., of Betley Hall, in Staffordshire, recommends
the preservation of apples for winter store, packed in banks or
hods of earth like potatoes. The method is said to be effectual and
economical.</p>

<p>Thomas Bond, Esq., of East Looe, in Cornwall, describes his mode of
cultivating strawberries. He does not adopt the common practice of
cutting off the runners, but they are confined to the bed by being
turned back among the plants from which they spring. In the autumn,
the beds are covered to the depth of two inches with fresh earth,
through which the strawberry plants shoot in the spring with great
vigour.</p>

<p>A kind of wicker basket is described, which is cheap and well adapted
for screening half hardy plants during the winter. It is fixed in the
earth by means of the points of the ribs of the wicker work, which
are allowed to project a few inches for the purpose.</p>

<p>It is stated by John Wedgewood, Esq., that good celery may be readily
obtained by transplanting seedling plants that have remained in the
seed bed, till they had acquired a
<span class="xxpn" id="p169">[p169]</span>
considerable size. They
grow more vigorously than the younger plants that are transplanted in
the usual way.</p>

<p>William Cotton, Esq., of Wellwood-house, describes the good effects
of painting an old garden wall with seal oil and anticorrosion paint.
The wall in question was covered with trees, which were every year
attacked by blight. Since the operation the trees have borne good
fruit, made healthy wood, and been free from the bad consequences of
blight.</p>

<p>Mr. John Mearns states, that the red and white Antwerp raspberries
may be brought to bear abundantly in August, long after the usual
crop of raspberries is past, by the following management. In May he
removes the young fruit, bearing shoots, from the canes, leaving in
some cases one or two eyes, in others, cutting them clean off. Under
either plan, they soon produce an abundance of vigorous new shoots,
which blossom freely in July.</p>

<p>Mr. Elias Hildyard, gardener to Sir Thomas Frankland, kills the grub
which infests his onion beds by trenching the beds in winter, digging
in manure at the same time, and leaving them exposed to the frost in
a rough state till the time of sowing.</p>

<p>A mode of inducing fertility in a barren Swan’s-egg pear-tree trained
upon a wall, is described by the Rev. John Fisher, of Wavenden, in
Buckinghamshire. It consists in twisting and breaking down the side
shoots of the main branches in such a way, as to make them pendulous
without separating them wholly from the parent limb. In a short time
a grumous formation takes place where the fracture has occurred, the
wound heals, the flow of the sap is moderated, and fruit buds are
formed instead of sterile shoots.</p>

<p>Mr. William Mowbray, gardener to the Earl of Mountnorris, states,
that the different species of eatable Passifloras which do not
generally produce fruit, may be induced to do so abundantly, if the
pollen of other species is applied to their stigmas.</p>

<p>Currants are preserved in perfection in the garden of James Webster,
Esq., of Westham, by being covered with bunting when the fruit is
fully ripe, care being had to unloose the bunting occasionally from
the bottom of the bushes, in order to remove the decaying fallen
leaves.</p>

but in this country it has long been expelled from the kitchen garden
by other kinds. It is, however, still seen in the gardens of France,
where it is commonly called Arroche des jardins, being used in that

<h4 class="hleft"><span class="allcaps">XIII</span>. <em class="italic">On planting the moist Alluvial Banks of Rivers with
Fruit-Trees</em>. By Mr. John Robertson. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h4>

<p class="first">The object of this writer is to show
that the low grounds that form
the banks of rivers are, of all others, the best adapted for the
growth of fruit trees; the alluvial soil of which they are composed,
being an intermixture of the richest and most soluble parts of the
neighbouring lands, with a portion of animal and vegetable matter,
affording an inexhaustible fund of nourishment. In such situations,
however, the trees are liable to injury from floods in the winter,
unless some means are used of draining off the stagnant water. This
is to be effected by digging deep trenches between the rows of trees,
casting up the earth from the trenches around the trees on either
side, so as to form elevated banks. Such is the practice in Holland,
where the western slopes of the dykes are generally covered with
fruit-trees, chiefly apples and pears. Mr. Robertson is of opinion,
that the banks should be raised, if possible, at least three or four
feet above the highest water-mark, and be made eighteen feet broad
at the base, and twelve at top; the trenches should be fifteen or
sixteen feet wide, admitting the soil to be three or four feet deep.</p>

<p>Upon this plan, it is probable that abundant crops would be obtained;
but with regard to the quality of the produce, we suspect it will be
quite as indifferent as the apples and pears of the Dutch, which are
notorious for their want of flavour.</p>

<h4><span class="allcaps">XIV</span>. <em class="italic">On Dahlias</em>.
By Mr. William Smith. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h4>

<p class="first">This is an attempt to distinguish by words the best varieties of
the Dahlia, and to fix the names of those which are the most worthy
of cultivation. Sixty kinds are well described,
<span class="xxpn" id="p171">[p171]</span>
arranged in
divisions depending upon the size of the plants and the colour of
their flowers. We do not propose to analyze this paper, which is far
too extensive for our limits; but instead, to throw together a few
remarks which are suggested by the subject.</p>

<p>The first fact to which we would call attention has reference to
acclimatization. The Dahlia has now been cultivated in Europe with
the utmost assiduity for nearly thirty years. During that period
millions of plants have been raised from seeds, and under almost
every possible variation of climate; and anomalies the most singular,
not only in colour, but in general constitution and physiological
structure, have been obtained. The colour of the flower has been
altered from pale yellow, or lilac, to every hue of red, purple,
or yellow, to pure scarlet and to deepest morone, or has even been
wholly discharged from the radial florets in the white varieties; the
period of flowering has been accelerated nearly two months; the tall
rank weed, exceeding the human standard in height, has been reduced
to a trim bush, emulating the pæony in dwarfishness; the yellow
inconspicuous florets of the disk have been expelled to make room for
the showy deep-coloured florets of the ray; what is more remarkable
still, the same yellow inconspicuous florets of the disk have been
enlarged, and stained with rich morone, so as to rival the colours of
the ray without losing their own peculiarity of form; and finally,
the whole foliage and bearing of the plant has been altered by the
substitution of simple leaves for compound ones. But notwithstanding
all this proneness to change, notwithstanding the multitude of
varieties which have been thus procured by seed, <em class="italic">not one individual
has yet been discovered, in any degree whatever, more hardy than its
ancestors</em>. The earliest frosts destroyed the Dahlias as certainly in
1826, as they could have done in 1789.</p>

<p>But, however strong may be the disposition of the Dahlia to vary
from its original structure, it is curious to observe how strictly
it conforms to the laws by which such variations are controlled
by nature. In altered structure all the changes take place from
circumference to centre. The florets of the ray displace those of the
disk, but the latter never attempt to occupy the ray; when a change
occurs among the florets of the disk, they merely dilate and assume
the colour of the ray, without changing their position or their
peculiar form. So with the leaves; by a reduction of the lateral
leaflet, till the terminal one only remains, simple foliage is
substituted for that which was compound: but no case has been found
in
<span class="xxpn" id="p172">[p172]</span>
which the suppression of the terminal leaflet has taken
place and the lateral ones have been preserved. In change of colour,
too, there is a circumstance which demands consideration, and of
which no explanation has yet been offered. It is not generally known,
although long ago noticed by M. De Candolle, that among flowers,
yellows will not produce blues, nor blues yellows, although both
these primitive colours will sport into almost every other hue. Thus
the hyacinth, the natural colour of which is blue, will not produce
a yellow, for the dull, half-green flowers called yellow hyacinths,
are, in our judgment, whites approaching green; the blue crocus will
not vary into yellow, nor the yellow into blue; and the ranunculus
and the dahlia, the natural colour of both which, notwithstanding
the popular belief to the contrary, with respect to the dahlia, is,
we believe, yellow, although they are the most sportive of all the
flowers of the gardens, varying from pink to scarlet, and deepest
shades of purple, have never yet been seen to exhibit any disposition
to become blue. This subject offers a most amusing field for
investigation, and would well repay the attentive consideration of
the philosopher.</p>

<p class="first">Mr. H. finds that the double red camellia, the double white, and
the double striped, will bear an English winter if planted out when
about two feet high, having been previously stunted in their growth
by repeatedly stopping their leading shoots. For two winters the
young plants are to be protected by a wooden screen fixed round
them, and covered by a hand-glass, the whole being enveloped in
mats; afterwards they require no other protection than to be guarded
from heavy snowstorms, and to be assisted by a thick covering of old
tan upon the ground in which they grow, to the distance of two or
three feet from their stems. If this success has been met with in
Yorkshire, what may not be expected in our more southern counties!
On the 12th of March of the present year these camellias were not

<p class="first">The fruits here described are of the highest excellence. They are,
1. the Marie Louise; 2. the Duchesse d’Angoulême; 3. the Doyenné
gris; 4. the Doyenné panaché; 5. the Beurré d’Aremberg; and 6. the
Gloux morceaux. The second, the fifth, and the sixth kinds are
represented in two very beautiful coloured plates; and are, perhaps,
the most exquisitely flavoured of all the varieties of the pear. The
Beurré d’Aremberg and Gloux morceaux are long keepers; the others
are autumnal kinds. Of the former it is said, “the flesh is whitish,
firm, very juicy, dissolves in the mouth, and is wholly destitute of
grittiness; it is sweet, rich, and so peculiarly high flavoured, that
I know no pear that can be compared with it in that respect.”</p>

The young plants are
well thinned during the summer; in the end of October they are very

<p class="first">This is in elaborate account of extraordinary specimens of hollies,
and appears to have been written with a view to induce the more
general cultivation in this country of that very valuable tree. At
Tynningham, the residence of the Earl of Harrington, are hedges
extending to no less a distance than 2952 yards, in some cases
thirteen feet broad, and twenty-five feet high. The age of these
hedges is something more than a century. At the same place are
individual trees of a size quite unknown in these southern districts.
One tree measured five feet three inches in circumference at three
feet from the ground; the stem is clear of branches to the height
of fourteen feet, and the total height of the tree is fifty-four
feet. The other places at which the hollies are of unusual size,
are Colinton-house the seat of Sir William Forbes; Moredun, the
seat of David Anderson, Esq.; Hopetoun-house, the seat of the Earl
of Hopetoun, and Gordon-castle, where are several large groups of
hollies, apparently planted by the hand of Nature.</p>

<h4><span class="allcaps">XXIII</span>. <em class="italic">An Account of a Plan of Heating Stoves by means of Hot
Water, employed in the Garden of</em> Anthony Bacon, Esq. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h4>

<p class="first">We conceive that a new æra in horticulture will commence with the
publication of this paper. We already possessed contrivances of a
sufficiently good kind for all purposes connected with artificial
climate, except the power of commanding heat; for which the two
methods hitherto employed have been either too clumsy or too costly,
and in either case liable to numerous objections. The old mode of
introducing heat into a stove, by means of brick flues, has long been
considered so bad, that every scheme that promised to supersede such
flues has been hailed with joy; the uncertainty of the quantity of
heat given out by a brick flue, its continual liability to explosion,
the impossibility of preventing the escape of smoke from between the
joints of the bricks, are all evils that require a remedy. For this
purpose steam was introduced, and with great advantage in extensive
ranges of hothouses. But the enormous expense of erecting a steam
<span class="xxpn" id="p175">[p175]</span>
apparatus, the danger attending its use in the charge of an
unskilful or careless gardener, and also the rapid loss of heat
from the pipes upon any neglect of the boiler, have all contributed
to prevent the use of steam becoming very general. The plan now
described has the great merit of possessing all the good qualities
of steam, without any of its objectionable accompaniments; its cost
cannot in any considerable degree exceed that of flues, and its
effects are so certain and durable, that a house so heated may be
almost said to be beyond the power of neglect on the part of the
gardener.</p>

<p>Without entering into the details of this plan, for which we must
refer to the paper itself, we shall content ourselves with explaining
its principle. Suppose two iron reservoirs, A and B, of equal
capacity, placed twenty feet apart, and connected at the top and the
bottom by iron pipes, the level of both reservoirs being the same;
it is obvious that water poured into one of these reservoirs will
flow into the other through the connecting pipes, and that it will
consequently stand at the same height in both. Let the reservoirs
be thus filled above the level of the uppermost pipe, and heat be
applied to the bottom of one reservoir, A; the water in this will
presently be forced through the upper pipe into the reservoir, B, of
water not heated; in proportion as the heated water flows out of A,
through the upper pipe, the cold water will flow out of B through
the lower pipe; and by this means a circulation of water heated and
water to be heated will be formed, which will continue as long as the
application of fire to the bottom of one reservoir is continued. When
it is discontinued, the temperature of the two reservoirs and of the
intermediate pipes will be the same within three or four degrees.
As it is the property of heated water to part with its heat very
slowly, it follows that heat will continue to be disengaged from the
reservoirs and pipes long after the application of fire has ceased.
In fact, when the two reservoirs are once heated, the gardener may
make up his fires and retire to rest, certain that his house is
sufficiently provided with heat for the night.</p>

principle. <span class="xxpn" id="p176">[p176]</span></p>

<h3><em class="italic">On the Recent Elucidations of early
Egyptian History</em>. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">S<span>INCE</span></span>
the commencement of the present century, the researches
of philologists have ascertained that the language of ancient
Egypt,—the language of the hieroglyphical inscriptions engraven
on its ancient temples and monuments, and of the still existing
manuscripts of the same period,—differs from the modern Egyptian
or Coptic, only in the mixture in the latter of many Greek and
Arabian and a smaller portion of Latin words, introduced during the
successive dominion of the Greeks, the Romans, and the Arabs, and
occasionally substituted for the corresponding native words. The
grammatical construction of the language has remained the same at
all periods of its employment: and it finally ceased to be a spoken
language towards the middle of the seventeenth century, when it was
replaced by the Arabian.</p>

<p>In writing their language, the ancient Egyptians employed
three different kinds of characters. First, <em class="italic">figurative</em>; or
representations of the objects themselves. Second, <em class="italic">symbolic</em>; or
representations of certain physical or material objects, expressing
metaphorically, or conventionally, certain ideas; such as, a
people obedient to their king, figured, metaphorically, by a bee;
the universe, conventionally, by a beetle. Third, <em class="italic">phonetic</em>, or
representative of sounds; that is to say, strictly alphabetical
characters. The phonetic signs were also portraits of physical and
material objects; and each stood for the initial sound of the word in
the Egyptian language which expressed the object pourtrayed: thus a
lion was the sound L, because a lion was called Labo; and a hand a T,
because a hand was called Tot. The form in which these objects were
presented, when employed as phonetic characters, was conventional,
and <em class="italic">definite</em> to distinguish them from the same objects used either
figuratively or symbolically; thus, the conventional form of the
phonetic T was the hand open and outstretched; in any other form
the hand would either be a figurative, or a symbolic sign. The
number of distinct characters employed as phonetic signs appears to
have been about 120; consequently many were homophones, or having
the same signification. The three kinds of characters were used
indiscriminately in the same writing,
<span class="xxpn" id="p177">[p177]</span>
and occasionally in the
composition of the same word. The formal Egyptian writing, therefore,
such as we see it still existing on the monuments of the country, was
a series of portraits of physical and material objects, of which a
small proportion had a symbolic meaning, a still smaller proportion a
figurative meaning, but the great body were phonetic or alphabetical
signs: and to these portraits, sculptured or painted with sufficient
fidelity to leave no doubt of the object represented, the name of
hieroglyphics, or sacred characters, has been attached from their
earliest historic notice.</p>

<p>The manuscripts of the same ancient period make us acquainted with
two other forms of writing practised by the ancient Egyptians, both
apparently distinct from the hieroglyphic, but which, on careful
examination, are found to be its immediate derivatives; every
hieroglyphic having its corresponding sign in the <em class="italic">hieratic</em>, or
writing of the priests, in which the funeral rituals, forming a
large portion of the manuscripts, are principally composed; and in
the <em class="italic">demotic</em>, called also the <em class="italic">enchorial</em>, which was employed for
all more ordinary and popular usages. The characters of the hieratic
are for the most part obvious running imitations, or abridgments
of the corresponding hieroglyphics; but in the demotic, which is
still further removed from the original type, the derivation is less
frequently and less obviously traceable. In the hieratic, fewer
figurative or symbolic signs are employed than in the hieroglyphic;
their absence being supplied by means of the phonetic or alphabetical
characters, the words being spelt instead of figured; and this is
still more the case in the demotic, which is, in consequence, almost
entirely alphabetical.</p>

<p>After the conversion of the Egyptians to Christianity, the ancient
mode of writing their language fell into disuse; and an alphabet was
adopted in substitution, consisting of the twenty-five Greek letters,
with six additional signs expressing articulations and aspirations
unknown to the Greeks, the characters for which were retained from
the demotic. This is the Coptic alphabet, in which the Egyptian
appears as a written language in the Coptic books and manuscripts
preserved in our libraries; and in which, consequently, the language
of the inscriptions on the monuments may be studied.
<span class="xxpn" id="p178">[p178]</span></p>

<p>The original mode in which the language was written having thus
fallen into disuse, it happened, at length, that the signification
of the characters, and even the nature of the system of writing
which they formed, became entirely lost; such notices on the subject
as existed in the early historians being either too imperfect,
or appearing too vague, to furnish a clue, although frequently
and carefully studied for the purpose. The repossession of this
knowledge will form, in literary history, one of the most remarkable
distinctions, if not the principal, of the age in which we live.
It is due primarily to the discovery by the French, during their
possession of Egypt, of the since well-known monument called the
Rosetta Stone, which, on their defeat and expulsion by the British
troops, remained in the hands of the victors, was conveyed to
England, and deposited in the British Museum. On this monument
the same inscription is repeated in the Greek and in the Egyptian
language, being written in the latter both in hieroglyphics and
in the demotic or enchorial character. The words Ptolemy and
Cleopatra, written in hieroglyphics, and recognized by means of
the corresponding Greek of the Rosetta inscription, and by a Greek
inscription on the base of an obelisk at Philæ, gave the phonetic
characters of the letters which form those words: by their means the
names were discovered, in hieroglyphic writing, on other monuments of
all the Grecian kings and Grecian queens of Egypt, and of fourteen
of the Roman emperors ending with Commodus; and by the comparison
of these names one with another, the value of all the phonetic
characters was finally ascertained.</p>

<p>The hieroglyphic alphabet thus made out has been subsequently
applied to the elucidation of the earlier periods of Egyptian
history, particularly in tracing the reigns and the succession of
the Pharaohs, those native princes who governed Egypt at the period
of its splendour; when its monarchy was the most powerful among the
nations of the earth; its people the most advanced in learning, and
in the cultivation of the arts and sciences; and which has left, as
its memorials, constructions more nearly approaching to imperishable,
than any other of the works of man, which have been the wonder of
every succeeding people, and which are now serving to re-establish,
at the expiration of above 3000 years, the details of
<span class="xxpn" id="p179">[p179]</span>
its
long-forgotten history. To trace these stupendous monuments of art
to their respective founders, and thus to fix, approximatively, at
least, the epoch of their first existence, is a consequence of the
restoration of the knowledge of the alphabet and the language of the
inscriptions engraven on them. We propose to review, briefly as our
limits require, the principal and most important facts that have thus
recently been made known in regard to those early times; and shall
deem ourselves most fortunate if we can impart to our readers but
a small portion of the interest which we have ourselves derived in
watching their progressive discovery.</p>

<p>The following are the authors to whom we are chiefly indebted for
the few particulars we know of early Egyptian history. Herodotus
and Diodorus Siculus, Grecians, and foreigners in Egypt. Manetho, a
native; and Eratosthenes, by birth a Cyrenean, a province bordering
on Egypt, both residents. Josephus, a Jew, and Africanus, Eusebius,
and Syncellus, Christians, Greek authors. Herodotus visited Egypt
four centuries and a half before Christ, and within a century after
its conquest by the Persians. In his relation of the affairs of
the Greeks and Persians, he has introduced incidentally a sketch
of the early history of Egypt, such as he learnt it from popular
tradition, and from information obtained from the priests. It is,
however, merely a sketch, particularly of the earlier times; and
is further recorded by Josephus to have been censured by Manetho
for its incorrectness. Diodorus is also understood to have visited
Egypt about half a century before Christ; and from him we have a
similar sketch to that of Herodotus; a record of the names of the
most distinguished kings, and for what they were distinguished;
but with intervals, of many generations and of uncertain duration,
passed without notice. Manetho was a priest of Heliopolis in Lower
Egypt, a city of the first rank amongst the sacred cities of ancient
Egypt, and long the resort of foreigners as the seat of learning
and knowledge. He lived in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, two
centuries and a half before Christ, and wrote, by order of that
prince, the history of his own country in the Greek language,
translating it, as he states himself, out of the sacred records.
His work is, most unfortunately, lost; but the fragments which have
been preserved to us, by the writings
<span class="xxpn" id="p180">[p180]</span>
of Josephus in the
first century of the Christian æra, and by the Greek authors above
named of the third and fourth centuries, contain matter, which, if
entitled to confidence, is of the highest historical value, <em class="italic">viz.</em>,
a chronological list of the successive rulers of Egypt, from the
first foundation of monarchy, to Alexander of Macedon, who succeeded
the Persians. This list is divided into thirty dynasties, not all of
separate families; a memorable reign appearing in some instances to
commence a new dynasty, although happening in the regular succession.
It originally contained the length of reign as well as the name
of every king; but in consequence of successive transcriptions,
variations have crept in, and some few omissions also occur in
the record, as it has reached us through the medium of different
authors. The chronology of Manetho, adopted with confidence by some,
and rejected with equal confidence by others,—his name and his
information not being even noticed by some of the modern systematic
writers on Egyptian history,—has received the most unquestionable
and decisive testimony of its general fidelity by the interpretation
of the hieroglyphic inscriptions on the existing monuments: so much
so, that by the accordance of the facts attested by these monuments
with the record of the historian, we have reason to expect the entire
restoration of the annals of the Egyptian monarchy antecedent to the
Persian conquest, and which, indeed, is already accomplished in part.</p>

<p>Before we pursue this part of our subject, we must conclude our
brief review of the original authorities in early Egyptian history,
by a notice of Eratosthenes. He was keeper of the Alexandrian
library in the reign of Ptolemy Evergetes, the successor to Ptolemy
Philadelphus, under whose reign Manetho wrote. Amongst the few
fragments of his works, which have reached us transmitted through
the Greek historians, is a catalogue of thirty-eight kings of
Thebes, commencing with Menes, (who is mentioned by the other
authorities also as the first monarch of Egypt,) and occupying by
their successive reigns 1055 years. These names are stated to have
been compiled from original records existing at Thebes, which city
Eratosthenes visited expressly to consult them. The names of the two
first kings in his catalogue are the same with the names of the two
first kings of the first dynasty of Manetho; but the
<span class="xxpn" id="p181">[p181]</span>
remainder
of the catalogue presents no further accordance, either in the names
or in the duration of the reigns.</p>

<p>To return to Manetho:—amongst the monarchs of the original Egyptian
race there was one named by him Amenophis, (the eighth king of the
eighteenth dynasty,) of whom it is stated, in a note of Manetho’s
preserved by Syncellus, that he was the Egyptian king whom the Greeks
called Memnon. The statue of Memnon at Thebes, celebrated through
all antiquity for the melodious sounds which it was said to render
at sunrise, is identified in the present day by a multitude of Greek
inscriptions; one of which, in particular, records the attestation of
Publius Balbinus, who visited the ruins of Thebes in the suite of the
empress the wife of Adrian, to his having himself heard the “divine
sounds of Memnon or Phamenoph;” which latter name is Amenophis, with
the Egyptian masculine article φ prefixed, and omitting the Greek
termination. The hieroglyphics carved on the statue, and coeval
with its date, had been very carefully copied by the French whilst
in possession of Egypt, and were engraved in the splendid work, the
<em class="italic">Description de l’Egypte</em>, to which their researches had given rise.
These hieroglyphics contain the alphabetic characters Amnf (being the
initial vowel and all the consonants of the name Amenof) inclosed
within a ring; a distinction which had been previously observed to
take place with the names of the Roman emperors, and of the Grecian
kings and queens; and as the rings have hitherto been found to occur
in no other instance whatsoever than when containing the names and
titles of sovereigns, they are regarded as characteristic signs.
It should be remarked, that in the hieroglyphic writing, as in the
languages of other eastern nations most nearly connected with Egypt,
the vowels are often omitted, and when expressed, have not always a
fixed sound. The coincidence of the reading of the hieroglyphic name
with that recorded by Manetho, and with the Greek inscription on
the statue itself, was so far confirmatory of Manetho’s authority;
it was also highly interesting in the evidence it afforded of the
employment of the same hieroglyphic alphabet, that was in after
use in the times of the Ptolemies and the Cæsars, even in the very
early periods of the Egyptian monarchy; for the reign of Amenophis
was in the dynasty preceding that of Sesostris: it also indicated
the further
<span class="xxpn" id="p182">[p182]</span>
advantage to be gained by the application of
the alphabet in decyphering other proper names, distinguished by
being inclosed in rings, existing on other statues, and in the more
ancient temples generally. Considerable progress had been made
in reading these, which in several instances had been found to
correspond with the names of the kings of the same and of subsequent
dynasties to Amenophis, as given by Manetho, when a most important
discovery was made of the existence of a genealogical record, in
hieroglyphics, of the titles of thirty-nine kings anterior to
Sesostris, chronologically arranged. We have already noticed that the
names and <em class="italic">titles</em> of kings were distinguished by being inclosed in
rings; the ring containing the proper name being accompanied usually
by a second, inclosing certain other hieroglyphics, expressing the
title by which that particular king was designated; and it appears
probable that the kings of Egypt were distinguished by their titles
rather than by their names, since the same name recurs frequently
in different individuals, but the titles are all dissimilar; with
a single exception amongst the very many that have come under
observation, and in which the same title is common to two brothers.
The signification of the titles is yet obscure, except that they are
of the same general nature as is frequent in the East, such as “Sun
of the Universe,” &#38;c.; but for the purpose of individualizing, the
sign is to us of the same value as the thing signified; and as other
monuments furnish the <em class="italic">names</em> in connexion with the <em class="italic">titles</em>, we are
enabled to compare the succession evidenced by the titles with the
record of the historian, and thus to test the fidelity of the record.
The discovery of this hieroglyphic table was made by Mr. William
Banks in 1818, in excavating for the purpose of obtaining an accurate
ground-plan of the ruins of Abydus, near Thebes. On a side wall
of one of the innermost apartments, hieroglyphics were sculptured
inclosed in rings, ranged symmetrically in three horizontal rows,
each row having originally contained twenty rings, of which twelve
of the upper row, eighteen of the middle, and fourteen of the lower
row were still remaining, the others having been destroyed by the
breaking down of the wall. The hieroglyphics having been copied
and lithographed, it was speedily recognised that the rings in the
two upper rows consisted of titles only; with the exception of one
<span class="xxpn" id="p183">[p183]</span>
proper name, the last of the second row, since known to be
the name of the king whose title is the last in the succession, and
who was the fourth in reign and generation before Sesostris. The
third row was recognised to consist of one proper name and one title,
each repeated ten times, and alternating with each other: these are
since known to be the name and title of Sesostris, to whose reign
the construction of the table is with much probability ascribed. The
titles in the same row with that of the ancestor of Sesostris and
preceding it, have been identified on other monuments, coupled with
names which are those of the predecessors of the same king in the
list of Manetho.</p>

<p>It would exceed our limits, and it is not our purpose, to trace in
detail the successive steps by which the existence of each of the
kings of Manetho’s list, from the expulsion of the Phœnician
shepherds from Lower Egypt, and the consequent union of Upper and
Lower Egypt in a single monarchy, to the reign of Sesostris, has been
attested by the monuments. Suffice it to say, that the same number of
individuals as stated by Manetho, namely, eighteen, filling a space
of four centuries, are shown, by the monuments, to have reigned in
that interval, and to have borne the same relationship, as well as
succession, to each other, as is expressed by the historian: that,
of the eighteen names, eight in different parts of the list are read
on the monuments identically as in the historical record; and that
in regard to the names that are not identical, we have the testimony
of Manetho that some amongst the kings, Sesostris, for example, were
known by two and even by more names. The table of Abydus appears to
have been strictly a genealogical record; a record of generations, in
which view it is strictly accordant with the historian.</p>

<p>The period of the Egyptian annals on which this light has been
thrown, is precisely that which might have been selected in the
whole history of Egypt as the most desirable for such purpose.
Independently of its very high antiquity, it was the period of the
greatest splendour and power of the native Egyptian monarchy, and
of the highest (Egyptian) cultivation of the arts. The greater part
of the more ancient, and by far the most admirable in execution,
of the temples, palaces, and statues, which still attest by their
ruins their former magnificence, are the work of that age; and
the hieroglyphic inscriptions still
<span class="xxpn" id="p184">[p184]</span>
extant on them, and
which, when not defaced by wanton injury, are almost as perfect
as when first executed, make known the reigns in which they were
respectively constructed, and frequently the purposes for which
they were designed. This is in itself no small achievement, when we
reflect that these extraordinary remains of ancient art were equally
the objects of vague wonderment in the times of the Roman emperors,
as they were in those of the generation preceding ourselves; but
that they are become to us objects of a more enlightened curiosity,
which they promise amply to repay, when the study that has already
made known their founders, shall reveal the signification of the
hieroglyphic histories, with which the walls of the palaces and
temples are covered. Already have we gained some very important
facts in regard to the condition, political and otherwise, of the
countries adjoining to Egypt at that early period. The monuments
of Nubia are covered with hieroglyphics, perfectly similar both in
form and disposition to those on the edifices at Thebes; the same
elements, the same formulæ, the same language; and the names of the
kings who elevated the most ancient amongst them, are those of the
princes who constructed the most ancient parts of the palace of
Karnac at Thebes. As far as Soleb on the Nile, 100 leagues to the
south of Philæ the extreme frontier of Egypt, are found constructions
bearing the inscriptions of an Egyptian king; evidencing that, during
the period of which we have been treating, Nubia was inhabited by
a people having the same language, the same belief, and the same
kings as Egypt. To the south of Soleb, and for more than 100 leagues
in ascending the Nile, in ancient Ethiopia, very recent travellers
have discovered the remains of temples, of the same general style
of architecture as those of Nubia and Egypt, decorated in the
same manner with hieroglyphics representing the same mythology,
and analogous to those of Egypt in the titles, and in the mode
of representing the names and titles, of the sovereigns. But the
proper names of the kings inscribed on the edifices of Ethiopia in
phonetic characters, have nothing in common with the proper names of
the Egyptian kings in the dynasties of Manetho; nor is one of the
Ethiopian names found either on the monuments of Nubia or of Egypt.
Thus there was a time when the civilized part of Ethiopia,—Meroe,
and the banks
<span class="xxpn" id="p185">[p185]</span>
of the Nile between Dongola and Meroe,—were
inhabited by a people having language, writing, religion, and arts
similar to Egypt; but, in political dominion, independent of that
country, and ruled by kings of whom it does not appear that any
historical record whatsoever has come down to us.</p>

<p>The dates of the expulsion of the Phœnican shepherds from
Egypt, and of the reign of Sesostris, in years of the æra of our
computation, have been favourite subjects of discussion with
chronologists: Archbishop Usher fixed the former of these events in
the year B. C. 1825; which would make the commencement of the reign
of Sesostris about B. C. 1483. The reign of Sesostris is connected
with the early Grecian chronology by the migration of Danaus, brother
of Sesostris, who, according to the Parian marbles, arrived in Greece
in 1485, which is a very few years earlier than the dates of Usher
would assign to that event. M. Champollion Figeac, brother of the M.
Champollion to whom the greater part of the discoveries made by the
interpretation of hieroglyphics are owing, himself a distinguished
chronologist, has assigned the year B.C. 1822 to the expulsion of
the Phœnicians, which Usher had placed in 1825: the date of
M. Champollion being derived from Manetho’s statement, that the
Phœnician invasion took place in the 700th year of the Sothiacal
period, <em class="italic">viz.</em>, B.C. 2082, and that their dominion in Egypt continued
260 years. Historical accuracy may make it desirable, that the exact
year of the most ancient as well as of more modern events should be
determined, if it be possible: but for purposes of general interest,
and especially for comparison with the chronology of cotemporary
nations, which at that early period is in every case more unsettled
than the Egyptian, the period seems sufficiently determined. The
date before Christ 1822, pursued downwards through the dynasties
of Manetho, conducts with very close approximation to the known
period B.C. 525 of the conquest of Egypt by the Persians; and
intermediately, accords very satisfactorily with the dates, according
to the Bible chronology, of the conquest of Jerusalem in the reign
of Jeroboam by Shishak, king of Egypt, and of Tirhakah, king of
Ethiopia and Egypt, who made war against Sennacherib; these are the
Sesonchis of Manetho, and Sh.sh.n.k of hieroglyphic inscriptions on
a temple at Bubaste, and on one of the courts of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p186">[p186]</span>
palace
at Karnac,—and the Taracus of Manetho, and T.h.r.k of hieroglyphic
inscriptions existing in Ethiopia and in Egypt<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-33" href="#fn-33">33</a>.</p>

<p>In respect to the connexion of the events of the Jewish and Egyptian
histories, the period between the expulsion of the Phœnicians and
the reign of Sesostris possesses a peculiar interest, as being that
of the residence of the Israelites in Egypt, and of the Exodus. In
the history of Josephus, we have an extract from Manetho, in which
this latter event is expressly stated to have taken place under
the father of Sesostris, a king whose name, in Manetho’s list, is
Amenophis, (the third of that name,) and on the monuments Ramses.
The date which chronologists are generally agreed in assigning
to the Exodus is 1491; that of the termination of the reign of
Amenophis, according to Champollion, is 1473, or, if the correction
of his chronology which we have suggested in a note be just, 1478:
it is singular that the difference of thirteen years (between 1491
and 1478) should be precisely the duration of a very suspicious
interval which Manetho states to have taken place, after Amenophis
had gone with his army in pursuit of the Israelites; and during which
interval neither the king nor his army returned to
<span class="xxpn" id="p187">[p187]</span>
Egypt, but
are stated to have been absent in Ethiopia. If the Exodus occurred
during the reign of any of the kings of the eighteenth dynasty, it
could only have been in the reign of the immediate predecessor of
Sesostris; since his conquests in Phœnicia, and his expeditions
against the Assyrians and Medes, must have brought him in contact
with the Israelites, had they been then residing in the Holy Land,
so as at least to have caused some mention to have been made in
their history of the passages of so great a conqueror. But presuming
Amenophis, father and predecessor of Sesostris, to have been the
Pharaoh of the Exodus, the wandering of the Israelites in the desert
for forty of the fifty-five years ascribed to the reign of Sesostris,
is a sufficient explanation of his being unnoticed in the Jewish
history; whilst the fact of that nation having been subject to the
Egyptians during the reign of Ousirei, commencing 124 years before
the death of Amenophis, is attested by the paintings on the wall of
one of the chambers of the tomb of that king, discovered by Belzoni,
and with which we are so well acquainted by means of the model
exhibited in England.</p>

<p>Whilst recalling to recollection the peculiar physiognomy of the Jews
pourtrayed in that tomb,—and which is as characteristic of their
present physiognomy as if it had been painted in the present age,
instead of above 3000 years ago,—the equally well characterized, but
very different physiognomy of the Phœnician shepherds, represented
on the monuments of the same period, is decisive of the error of
Josephus, who imagined the Jews and the Shepherds to be the same
people. The Phœnician shepherds, long the inveterate enemy of the
Egyptians, form a leading feature as captives, in the representations
of the exploits of the monarchs who conducted the warfare against
them. These people are always painted with blue eyes and light hair;
and it is not a little curious to see assembled on the wall of the
same apartment, different races, so distinctly characterised as
the Jew, the Phœnician, the Egyptian, and the Negro; the latter
in colour, and in the outline of the features, in painting and in
sculpture, precisely as at present; all, moreover, inhabitants of
countries not very distant from each other, and at a period when not
more than twelve or thirteen centuries had passed since all these
races had descended from a single parent. In the writings which
attempt to explain from natural causes
<span class="xxpn" id="p188">[p188]</span>
the diversity of race
amongst mankind, much power has been ascribed to the effects of time
and climate: but the facts with which we are now becoming better
acquainted than before, do not appear to admit of explanation from
those circumstances. It is worthy of notice that the negro, and the
light-haired and blue-eyed people, the two races who might be deemed
at the greatest distance apart amongst the varieties of man, are,
equally with the intermediate Egyptians, the descendants of Ham.</p>

<p>Of the succession of kings in Manetho’s chronology, from Sesostris to
the Persian conquest, a space of nine centuries and a half, about one
half the names have been already identified on different monuments:
four of the Persian monarchs, subsequent to the conquest, have also
been traced in inscriptions in phonetic characters; their names
are written, as nearly as can be spelt with our letters, Kamboth,
(Cambyses); Ntariousch, (Darius); Khschearscha, (Xerxes); and
Artakschessch, (Artaxerxes.)</p>

<p class="clearfix">The ascent by monumental evidence to yet more remote antiquity than
the expulsion of the Phœnician shepherds, (B.C. 1822), is not
altogether without hope, notwithstanding the general demolition of
the temples of the gods, which took place according to Manetho,
during the long dominion of the Phœnicians in Egypt. We learn from
the <em class="italic">Description de l’Egypte</em> that even the most ancient structures
at Thebes are themselves composed of the debris of still more ancient
buildings, used as simple materials, on which previously sculptured
and painted hieroglyphics are still existing; these are doubtless the
remains of the demolished temples, but the inscriptions will require
to be studied on the spot. There is also reason to believe, that
there exists amongst the ruins of the palace of Karnac, a portion of
still more ancient construction than the palace itself; which, having
escaped demolition, was incorporated with the more recent building.
The inscriptions on this apparently very ancient ruin present the
name and title of a king, which form a very interesting subject for
future elucidation. The title does not accord with any one now extant
on the table of Abydus, but possibly may have been one of those which
were destroyed with a portion of the wall, and which are of kings
of earlier date than the expulsion of the shepherds. The name is
Mandouei, which name occurs in the dynasty anterior to Sesostris, but
coupled
<span class="xxpn" id="p189">[p189]</span>
with a different title, an effectual distinction; nor
does the name recur in any subsequent dynasty. M. Champollion Figeac
has, with much ingenuity, shown the probability of the identity of
the Mandouei of the ancient ruin with the Osymandyas, Ousi-Mandouei,
mentioned by Diodorus Siculus as an Egyptian king greatly
distinguished by his conquests, whose reign M. Champollion infers,
from the historical passages relating to him, to have commenced
190 years before the Phœnician invasion, or B.C. 2272 years; a
prodigious antiquity, and of the very highest interest should it be
established, since there exist of this individual no less than three
statues in European collections, distinguished by the same name
and title: two of these are colossal, one at Turin, and a second
at Rome: a third is in the British Museum; and as all particulars
must interest which relate to a statue, of which there is at least
probability that is the most ancient existing in the world,—the date
attributed to it being earlier than the birth of Abraham,—we copy
from Burckhardt the following short description of its discovery:
“Within the inclosure of the interior part of the temple at Karnac,
Belzoni found a statue of a hard, large-grained sandstone: a whole
length naked figure sitting upon a chair with a ram’s head upon the
knees: the face and body entire; with plaited hair falling down to
the shoulders. This is one of the first, I should say, the first
Egyptian statue I have seen: the expression of the face is exquisite,
and I believe it to be a portrait.”—(J. L.
<span class="smcaps">B<span>URCKHARDT</span></span>, <em class="italic">Travels
in Nubia</em>, lxxvii. <em class="italic">Letter to Mr. W. Hamilton, 20th February,
1817</em>.)—This statue is in the farthest corner on the right hand
side after entering the gallery of the Egyptian antiquities in the
British Museum; and compared with other statues in the same gallery,
which are of kings of the eighteenth dynasty, the dissimilarity of
the features from the very characteristic ones of the latter family
is too striking to be questioned. The problem of the age of this king
Mandouei is, at all events, a highly curious one; and will probably
receive its solution amongst the many other valuable discoveries
which cannot fail to result from M. Champollion’s projected visit to
Egypt, in which he will be accompanied by the sincere good wishes of
every one in every country, who feels an interest in the restoration
of authentic history.

It appears to us that a slight inaccuracy has crept into the
deduction of all the dates in M. Champollion’s Chronology subsequent
to the expulsion of the shepherds. The date of that event is the
foundation of the subsequent dates, and is supposed to have taken
place B.C. 1822; after which, according to the extract of Manetho in
Josephus cited by M. Champollion, Thoutmosis, the king by whom they
had been expelled, reigned 25 years and 4 months, followed by the
other kings of the eighteenth dynasty, making altogether 342 years
and 9 months: (including the 2 years and 2 months additional of
Horus, in compliance with the version of the passage in the Armenian
text of the Chronicle of Eusebius.) This number, 342 years and 9
months, falling short of the 348 years attributed to the eighteenth
dynasty in Eusebius and Syncellus, M. Champollion has suggested that
Thoutmosis may have reigned the five years which constitute the
difference, before the expulsion of the shepherds, since, according
to the record, he did reign, some years before that event, over
all the parts of Egypt not possessed by the shepherds. So far, so
well: but in such case, the year B.C. 1822, being the epoch of the
expulsion of the shepherds, and not of the commencement of the
eighteenth dynasty, must surely correspond to the fifth year of the
reign of Thoutmosis, and not to the first, as M. Champollion makes
it. We have hesitated to venture this remark on a matter to which M.
Champollion must have given much attention, believing that mistake
in us is much more probable than an accidental inadvertence in
him; but we have returned frequently to the consideration, without
having been able to satisfy ourselves; and the rectification of our
mistake, if it is one, may prevent others falling into the same.

<h3><em class="italic">Proceedings of the Horticultural Society</em>. <a href="#jpart1">◊</a></h3>

<h4><em class="italic">June 19th</em>.</h4>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">A<span>T</span></span>
this meeting a paper was read from the President, T. A. Knight,
Esq., upon the culture of the mango and cherimoyer. Its object was to
suggest some improvements in the management of these and other trees
cultivated in stoves, deduced from an application of Dutrochet’s
electrical theory of vegetation to practice. It has now become
generally known that this observer is of opinion that the motion
of the fluids in plants depends upon two currents of electricity,
setting with very unequal force between the denser fluid of the tree
and the lighter fluid of the soil in which the tree is planted; the
more powerful current setting from the latter to the former, and
so producing absorption, by conveying aqueous particles into the
roots, through the vegetable membrane of the epidermis. In applying
this theory to practical purposes, Mr. Knight recommends that the
pot in which the cherimoyer or mango is planted, should itself be
surrounded by a medium through which an equable and regular supply
of fluid may be conveyed to the roots, and that the naked surface
of the pot should by no means be exposed to the free action of the
atmosphere. Without entering upon any question of the accuracy of
the French philosopher’s observations, it is quite certain that such
a mode of cultivation is that which is most congenial to plants,
and which is indispensable to those of a habit at all delicate. The
common practice of plunging pots into a tan-bed, or among sand, if
in glass-houses, or in the earth if in open borders, is a proof of
the necessity that gardeners have found, of securing as regular a
temperature and degree of humidity as is possible for the outside of
their flower-pots; through the pores in which, moisture is chiefly
conveyed to the roots, which always cling to the inside surface of
the pot.</p>

<p>Specimens of roses produced by branches budded upon the Rosa indica,
were exhibited by Alexander Evelyn, Esq. We notice these not only
on account of their extraordinary beauty, but also for the sake
of recommending most strongly the adoption of the practice where
delicate roses are found difficult of cultivation <em class="italic">per se</em>. If we
consider what happens when the operation of budding, or grafting
has succeeded, the reason of the advantage derived from such an
operation will be apparent. When a bud of one variety is inserted
under the bark of another variety, a union takes place between the
cellular substance of the two; the bud is then placed in the same
<span class="xxpn" id="p191">[p191]</span>
situation with regard to the stock, as the seed when sown
is with regard to the earth. It immediately derives its nutriment
from the ascending sap of the new tree, and begins to form its wood
and branches, and to secrete its proper juices in proportion to the
supply of food it now receives. If a plant from any cause produces
roots with difficulty, its whole habit will be delicate, and its
flowers if formed, will, as in the case of that most lovely of
flowers, the double yellow rose, probably fall off without expanding,
from the want of an adequate supply of nutriment from its roots;
but, as in all trees, every bud is, when fully formed, in itself a
perfect and distinct individual, if such an individual be removed
from its own root, and placed where it will be supported by the
healthy vigorous roots of another species of variety, which happens
in budding, it will no longer have to depend upon a source, the
supplies from which are imperfect, but on the contrary, like a seed
removed from barren fertile ground, it will flourish in a degree
before unknown. The contrary effect takes place when a vigorous plant
is transferred to one less vigorous. And hence, the whole effect of
stocks upon the scions, or buds inserted upon them.</p>

<p>There was also a great variety of fruit and flowers upon the table,
and seeds of several useful vegetables were distributed.</p>

<h4><em class="italic">July 3rd</em>.</h4>

<p>Seven medals were awarded to different individuals for fruit sent
by them to the Society’s fête on the 23rd of June; and one to Capt.
Drummond, for his “successful exertions in bringing living plants of
the mangosteen from the East Indies.” A paper by the president was
read upon an improvement in the mode of constructing hotbeds, but we
despair of explaining it successfully without reference to figures.
Among the display of fruits and flowers, which were exceedingly
numerous, we were particularly struck by a collection of twenty-two
varieties of strawberries from the Society’s garden.</p>

<p>Upon this occasion, thirty-nine new members were either ballotted
for, or proposed, a striking proof of the estimation in which the
Society is held by the public.</p>

<h4><em class="italic">July 17th</em>.</h4>

<p>Upon this occasion, an enormous pine-cone from the River Columbia
was exhibited. It measured
<span class="mixfract">16<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
inches in length, and was stated
to have been procured by the Society’s collector, Mr. David Douglas.
Its seeds were represented to be as large as those of the stone-pine,
and eatable. The tree is of the family of Pinus strobus,
<span class="xxpn" id="p192">[p192]</span>
and
will be an invaluable acquisition to our forests, if it should prove
to succeed as well in this climate as in its own. We have already
given some account of this plant in the last number of the old series
of this Journal. The usual display was made of the finest fruit and
flowers of the season.</p>

<h4><em class="italic">August 7th</em>.</h4>

<p>A complete coloured set of the costly Flora danica was placed upon
the table, having been presented by His Majesty the King of Denmark.
An improved apparatus for fumigating hothouses was exhibited by its
inventor, Mr. John Read: it consists of a brass cylinder, attached to
the orifice of a pair of bellows, and fitted up with a chimney and
draft-hole closed by a valve. The tobacco is put into the cylinder
and ignited, and the blast from the bellows expels the smoke.
The contrivance is ingenious enough, but while a hot-house fifty
feet long, may be filled with smoke in ten minutes by means of a
flower-pot, with a hole in its bottom, and a common pair of bellows,
we cannot recommend any more expensive, and certainly less efficient
apparatus.</p>

<p>The table was covered with a profusion of fruits and flowers.</p>

<h4><em class="italic">August 21st</em>.</h4>

<p>The meeting-room this day exhibited a gratifying proof of the
excellence of the productions of our English gardens. Of <em class="italic">flowers</em>,
there were dahlias of the richest colours, and the most varied hues;
some produced by plants that retain all their ancient stature, and
others by dwarfs which seem to have lost nearly every character of
the dahlia but its beauty. Of <em class="italic">fruits</em>, there were endless varieties
of apricots, apples, pears, peaches, nectarines, grapes, pine-apples,
and melons; one of the latter, from the garden of John Fuller, Esq.,
weighed thirteen pounds. The best apricot was the Moorpark; the best
apple, the Duchess of Oldenburg, than which no princess has a fairer
bloom, the best pear the Jargonelle, the best peach the Bourdine
(forced), the best pine apple the Black Jamaica. We mention these as
a guide to our readers, in their purchases of fruit-trees; for it is
certain, that no greater service can be rendered to the public, than
to point out the means by which they may avoid encumbering themselves
with the polyonymous trash with which every nursery abounds.

<div class="h5d"><h5>1. <em class="italic">On the
combined Action of a Current of Air
and the Pressure of the Atmosphere</em>.</h5>—The phenomena observed
by M. Clement Désormes<a class="fnanchor" id="fnanchor-34"
href="#fn-34">34</a>, when a flat plate is opposed to air or vapour
passing into the atmosphere from an aperture in a plane surface,
have been rendered so easy of production by M. Hachette, as to be
at the command of any person in any situation. M. Hachette has also
accompanied the description of his instruments with elucidations,
experiments, and philosophical reasonings.</div>

<p>The first simplification by M. Hachette was to make the nozzle of
a pair of double chamber-bellows terminate in the middle of a flat
plate; he found that when the bellows were worked, effects were
produced opposite the jet of air of the kind described by M. Clement,
disks of card and other substances being drawn towards the aperture
against the direction of the current. At the same time that he
described this experiment, he also announced his having produced the
same effects by using a stream of water instead of a stream of air.</p>

<div class="figc-s3">
<img src="images/i193.jpg" width="456" height="440" alt="" />
<div class="captable"><div class="tabrow">
<div class="cell50"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 1.</div>
<div class="cell50"><em class="italic">Fig.</em> 2.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The apparatus was still further simplified, so as to make the stream
of air from the mouth sufficient to produce the effect. A tin tube,
A, <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 1, was soldered to the middle of a round tin plate, in
the centre of which was a small orifice, E; three or four small
projections of the tin, <em class="italic">f f</em>, were left at the edges of the plate,
to prevent the disks of paper, card, or metal, from slipping off
sideways. The figure is on a scale of one-half. Instead of the tin
plate, a piece
<span class="xxpn" id="p194">[p194]</span>
of smooth cork may be used, and for the tin
tube, a glass tube, or one made by rolling up a piece of paper.</p>

<p>If the tube be held horizontally, or inclining a little upward, and a
disk of card or paper be placed loosely against the aperture in the
plate, it will be found that, on applying the mouth to the end of
the tube, and blowing air through, that the disk will not be driven
away, but actually made to apply closely to the surface of the plate;
and if turned towards the ground it will be found to remain opposite
the hole, and not to fall until the current of air is stopped. Even
a plate of tin may in this way be suspended by a current of air;
which at first would be supposed to conjoin with gravity in forcing
it to the ground. When the disk is flexible and slightly elastic, a
heavy sound, and sometimes even a shrill tone, is produced by the
vibrations of the plate.</p>

<p>In explanation of this experiment, M. Hachette says, “The air is
pushed from the mouth A of the tube, towards the orifice E of the
plate; it strikes the part of the disk opposed to this orifice,
and the mean pressure on that part is greater than the pressure of
the atmosphere. The blown air then takes place of that between the
plate and the disk opposed to it; it moves in this interval with a
velocity decreasing from the edges of the aperture: the elastic force
of this air decreases at the same time, so that its mean pressure
between the plate and the inner face of the disk becomes less than
the atmospheric pressure; and as this last pressure is exerted on the
whole external face of the disk H, I, this disk, subject at the same
time to the two contrary pressures on its opposing faces, obeys the
greater, and is pushed towards the plate C D.”</p>

<p>“It is not necessary that the disk, C D, should be near the orifice E,
of the tube A E. Let <em class="italic">Fig.</em> 2 be an instrument composed of a hollow
cylinder, C D F G, and a flat border of the dimensions C″ F, or G D″.
Let a tube, A E, be fixed to the bottom of the cylinder, the orifice
E having a diameter of about three millimeters (0.12 of inch). If
air be blown in at A, against the disk, H I, in the neighbourhood
of the flat border, the disk will be urged towards the orifice E.
This instrument is also delineated on a scale of one half. The disk,
with the attached weight, weighs about 12 grammes (184.87 grains),
being 54 millimeters in diameter; the pressure of the atmosphere
upon it equals 23 kilogrammes: from which it follows that, in this
experiment, the pressure of the air blown upon the inner surface of
the disk, and the atmospheric pressure exerted on the exterior of the
same disk, only differs from each other by about one two-thousandth
part of the latter.”—<em class="italic">Annales de Chimie</em>, xxxv. 34.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>2. <em class="italic">Considerations relative to Capillary
Action, by</em> M. Poisson.</h5>—M. Dutrochet, whilst explaining his
views relative to the cause of vital movement in plants and animals,
stated that if an animal or vegetable membrane were formed into a
bag, having a tube of <span class="xxpn" id="p195">[p195]</span>
glass attached to its aperture, and were then filled with a liquid
substance, having a strong affinity for another liquid, into which
the bag was to be immersed, it would not only have the power of
absorbing the latter liquid into its pores, but also, in certain
cases, of forcing it up to the top, and even out of the glass tube
held in a vertical position. On this point, a difference of opinion
with regard to the force of capillarity took place: M. Ampère
maintaining that capillary action would raise the fluid to the top of
the tube, but not cause its expulsion; while M. Poisson maintained
that, in certain cases, the latter effect could be produced. The
latter has since then published a note, which we transcribe in part,
from the <em class="italic">Annales de Chimie</em>, xxxv. 98.</div>

<div class="figright isize7">
<img src="images/i195.jpg" width="144" height="203" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Suppose that two different fluids, A, B, are contained in a vessel,
and separated the one from the other by a vertical division; the
heights being in an inverse ratio to the densities, so that the
points, <em class="italic">a</em> and <em class="italic">b</em>, in the two faces of the division, and situated
in the same horizontal plane, shall support equal and opposite
pressures: suppose also that the division is pierced with one or more
holes of small diameter, or, in other words, that it is traversed by
several very narrow canals, as <em class="italic">a</em>, <em class="italic">b</em>, perpendicular to the two
faces, and which may be regarded at first as filled with air, or any
other fluid.</p>

<p>If the substance of the division exerts upon each of the two liquids
an action superior to the half of that which the liquid has upon
itself, each liquid will enter into the canal <em class="italic">a</em>, <em class="italic">b</em>, just as it
would rise above its ordinary level in a capillary tube of the same
size and substance. It would also be urged, by the excess of pressure
which it would exert at the extremity of the canal, against the
elasticity of the included air. When the two fluids have penetrated
the interior of <em class="italic">a</em>, <em class="italic">b</em>, the air will be pushed on both sides
in different directions by forces each of which is equal to the
primitive pressure augmented by the corresponding capillary force,
<em class="italic">i. e.</em> augmented by forces proportional, according to the known
theory of M. Laplace, to double the action of the tube on the liquid,
less the proper action of the liquid itself. It will only be in the
case when the capillary force shall be the same on both sides, that
the air, after being compressed to a certain degree, will remain at
rest: for whenever this force preponderates at one end of the canal,
the air will be driven out at the opposite end, and the liquid with
the strongest capillary attraction will entirely fill the canal.</p>

<p>Suppose this liquid to be A, then let us consider the forces which
will act on the portion <em class="italic">a</em>, <em class="italic">b</em>, of this liquid. At the extremity
<em class="italic">a</em>, it will be submitted to the attraction of the exterior fluid
A: at the extremity <em class="italic">b</em>, it will be attracted in the opposite
direction by the liquid B. Now the two liquids being different, their
attractions will be unequal, and we will suppose that that of B, on
the matter
<span class="xxpn" id="p196">[p196]</span>
of A, is greater than that of A for itself. As to
the action of the canal on the portion <em class="italic">a</em>, <em class="italic">b</em>, that will be equal,
and exerted in contrary directions at its two extremities; it will
not, therefore, be either adverse or favourable to the movement of
the fluid in the canal: and the same will be the case with respect
to the pressures exerted at <em class="italic">a</em> and <em class="italic">b</em>, by the external liquids, as
long as they are equal: nevertheless, the action of the canal, and
the external pressures, will prevent the thread of fluid from being
broken, so that it will move without interruption in the direction
in which it is drawn by the greatest attraction, or from <em class="italic">a</em> to <em class="italic">b</em>.
Hence will result an elevation of the level of B, and, consequently,
an increase of pressure at the extremity <em class="italic">b</em>, of the passage, and
this elevation will proceed until the difference of pressure in <em class="italic">a</em>
and <em class="italic">b</em> shall be equal to that of the attractions exerted by the two
fluids A and B, on the thread <em class="italic">a b</em>; this effect will be produced
the more rapidly as the division is pierced with a greater number of
passages similar to that which has been considered.</p>

<p>Now let us examine what would occur if the division were formed
of two others different in their nature, and exactly superposed;
exerting no action on one of the liquids, B for example, and one
only acting on the other liquid. The liquid B will then retain its
original position undisturbed; in consequence of the action it exerts
upon itself it cannot penetrate the canal <em class="italic">a b</em>, just as mercury
cannot escape by a capillary aperture made in a barometer-tube.
It will be the same with A, when that face of the division which
exerts no action upon the liquid is turned towards it; so that how
numerous soever the apertures, the two liquids would, under such
circumstances, remain separate and preserve their original level. But
if the division be turned so that the face which acts upon A shall
be in contact with that liquid, it will penetrate the canal <em class="italic">a b</em>
by means of capillary attraction; and the velocity which the liquid
urged by this force may acquire, may make it pass that point in the
canal where the division changes its nature, and even make it reach
the extremity in the liquid B, so that it is possible that the liquid
A should entirely fill the canal <em class="italic">a b</em>, as in the case which has
already been examined. Then if we always suppose the attraction of B
for A to be superior to that which A has for itself, the thread <em class="italic">a b</em>
will flow into B until the level of the latter is so far altered
that the excess of pressure at <em class="italic">b</em> can balance the difference of
attractions exerted by the two liquids at <em class="italic">a</em> and <em class="italic">b</em>.</p>

<p>M. Poisson then observes that, without pretending to assign a cause,
exclusive of all others, for the phenomena of absorption by vegetable
and animal membranes observed by M. Dutrochet, his object is to
show that effects which have at least a great resemblance to these
important phenomena, may be produced by capillary action conjoined
with the difference of affinity existing between heterogeneous
substances without the assistance of electricity, either moving or
quiescent. It appears that M. Dutrochet afterwards
<span class="xxpn" id="p197">[p197]</span>
found
mineral substances, as a piece of slate, might be substituted for the
organized tissues; this being the case, the opinion which refers such
effects to a general cause, as capillary attraction, acquires more
probability.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>3. <em class="italic">Novel Use of the
Plough</em>.</h5>—Mr. Bruckmann states that he has
long thought the plough might be used in levelling roads and
clearing the foundations for fortifications. In 1824 he had an
opportunity of applying it in the construction of a canal required
to furnish a motive force for the service of the rock-salt works of
Friedrichshall. The bed was to have a section of 700 square feet, and
it had been calculated that the excavations would require 200 men for
two years, whereas the king of Wurtemburg wished it to be done in one
year from the spring of 1824.</div>

<p>Three ploughs were employed; the first had two handles, a coulter,
and a share, the latter being in the form of a wedge. This plough
was preferred in the beds and gravelly grounds; and it was found
advantageous to give it an oscillatory movement by the handles during
its progress. Drawn by eight horses, it could turn up 25,000 cubic
feet of an argillaceous soil, in three hours; with ten horses it
turned up 19,800 cubic feet of a gravelly soil, in the same time.
This plough was tried in 1815, against fifteen others of the ordinary
kind, in the construction of a watercourse for a mill; all the
fifteen were quickly broken by the work.</p>

<p>The second plough had two handles and a coulter, but the share had
only one cutting edge, which was rounded and with an ear. It was
made five times as strong as an ordinary plough, and succeeded well
in compact and argillaceous soils, where, with eight horses and four
men, it moved 48,000 cubic feet of earth in three hours. In case of
fracture ten minutes sufficed to change the coulter and share, and,
during the work, 2,300,000 cubic feet of earth were loosened by it.</p>

<p>The third plough was smaller and lighter, it had two handles, a
coulter, an ear, and a share, the latter lance-shaped. It was used
for excavating the sides of the canal, on which the horses attached
to the first plough found it difficult to walk because of the
inclination. It was worked by ten or twelve men.</p>

<p>To establish an accurate comparison between the work of these ploughs
and that done by the pickaxe and spade, a piece of ground was wrought
solely in the latter manner by six strong working men. The result of
a long trial was the breaking of 150 cubic feet of ground by each man
in nine hours. Comparing this result with the work of the ploughs,
the following are the results:—The first plough did the work of 477
men, the second of 960 men, and the third that of 50 or 60 men. The
canal was finished on April 30th, 1825, the ploughs having saved
32,000 days, according to the work-day of a labourer.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em>

<div class="h5d"><h5>4. <em class="italic">Discovery of
Rocks under the Surface of the Sea</em>.</h5>—The fishers
of the Mediterranean use an apparatus for the discovery of rocks
beneath the surface in those places where they wish to cast their
nets, which supplies, in a great measure, the insufficiencies of the
ordinary means of taking soundings. The method consists in carrying
a long and thin cord over the bottom to be examined, and which, when
it meets with an obstacle, is stopped by it and becomes folded in
the place where it occurs. It will easily be understood, that when a
cord has been carried over a certain space without meeting with any
resistance, that proof is obtained of the non-existence of rocks or
other obstacles, at a depth less than that to which the cord has been
sunk; and as the examination can easily be carried on to 100 feet
below the surface, it may be said that, wherever such an apparatus
has passed unimpeded, the navigation is free. If, on the contrary,
some isolated rocks are found during the examination, the place where
the cord becomes doubled points out the locality, which may then
be determined more accurately by other trials, and the summit and
neighbourhood of the submersed rocks be accurately examined by means
of soundings.—<em class="italic">Annales Marit.</em>;

<div class="h5d"><h5>5. <em class="italic">Paper to resist
Humidity</em>.</h5>—This process, which is due to M. Engle, consists in
plunging unsized paper once or twice into clear solution of mastic in
oil of turpentine, and drying it by a gentle heat. The paper, without
becoming transparent, has all the properties of writing-paper, and
may be used for the same purposes. It is especially recommended for
passports, workmen’s books, legal papers, &#38;c. When preserved
for years it is free from injury, either by humidity, mice, or
insects. It is further added, that a solution of caoutchouc will
produce even a still better effect.—<em class="italic">Kunst und
Gewerbe-blatte</em>.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>6. <em class="italic">Professor Amici’s
Microscopes</em>.</h5>—This distinguished personage has lately exhibited
to the <em class="italic">savans</em> of this country two microscopes
of his own workmanship,—an achromatic refractor, and a reflector
of his own particular invention. The object-glass of his refractor
is of a very complicated construction, and is composed of three
double-object glasses combined together in the space of about an
inch. The flint-glass from which his concaves are formed is of
the manufacture of Frauenhofer; his convexes are of Dutch plate,
crown-glass, and French plate, separately. Each object-glass detached
has but a small aperture, and is of long focus; but when the three
are combined together, the angle of aperture is very considerable,
and the focus short. By this ingenious arrangement the trouble and
difficulty of manipulating deep single-object-glasses of large
aperture is avoided; but advantages gained one way, in practical
optics, are generally lost in another, and the twelve surfaces of
the objective produce a kind of softness and muddiness in <span
class="xxpn" id="p199">[p199]</span> the image strongly contrasted by
the effect of a good single triple-glass of equivalent power. When,
however, only two of the object-glasses are combined, the effect is
very fine. Between the object-glass and eye-glasses is placed one
of those prisms originally invented by Sir I. Newton to act as an
eye-piece of his telescope, and of which a description may be seen in
his correspondence at the end of Dr. Gregory’s Optics. The utility
of the introduction of this device appears very questionable in an
instrument already so complicated. The diversion of the rays into a
course at a right angle to their original progress (merely to give
an horizontal instead of a vertical position to the body) is surely
no warrant for the employment of two extra refracting surfaces and
one reflexion, which cannot fail to have a pernicious influence on
the formation of the image. An horizontal position of the body is
attained with the utmost facility by a proper construction of the
mounting, &#38;c. Setting aside the dulness of the image produced
by the numerous refractions, the performance of the instrument on
test-objects was highly respectable and satisfactory.</div>

<p>The reflector is a modification of the original construction
recommended by the Professor, who seems to have profited by the
schooling he received from Dr. Goring, and now sails much closer to
the wind than he did. His objective metal is now two inches focus,
with an aperture of
<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
inch; but half an inch is cut off for the
purpose of preventing the bad effect of the marginal rays, so that
only 1 inch of the central portion of the metal is employed;—the
diameter of the diagonal mirror is also reduced to its proper
standard, by which means the blot in the centre of the visual
pencil is rendered as small as possible. It may be asserted of this
instrument, that it does as much as can possibly be expected from an
objective part of 2 inches focus, showing many test-objects faintly,
and with much effort; but it is totally unable to compete with deeper
ones equally perfect and of the same angular opening. The Professor
has, in some of his instruments, reduced the focus of the elliptic
metal to
<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
inch, and will, no doubt, gradually slide into the
adoption of that radical reform in his instrument, so happily carried
into effect in this country by Dr. Goring, in conjunction with Mr.
Cuthbert,—at least if the figuration of elliptic metals of
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">10</span></span>
inch focus with
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span><span class="fdn">10</span></span>
inch of aperture shall not surpass his powers
of execution. During the Professor’s stay in this country there
was a grand field-day at his hotel, at which <em class="italic">both his microscopes
were tried against the Goringian modification of the reflector, the
superior weight of metal of which completely beat every thing opposed
to it</em>. For the honour of the Professor it must be stated, that he
admitted this defeat with great candour and good sense, and even had
some difficulty in believing in the identity of some of the objects
used, so differently was the ordinary apparent structure developed
by the English improvements on his instrument. It may with safety
be averred that no refractor, at least, will ever be
<span class="xxpn" id="p200">[p200]</span>
made
to surpass <em class="italic">Dr. Goring’s improved Amician Engiscope</em>; and it seems
equally certain that no other reflector will ever be invented capable
of the same facilities of application to the examination of both
opaque and transparent objects. If Professor Amici has been beaten,
it has been done with his own weapons,—the copy has surpassed the
original,—the child, by virtue of foreign nursing and tuition, has
exceeded the stature and strength of the father.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>1. <em class="italic">On the Specific Heat of
Gases, by</em> <span class="allcaps">MM</span>.
de la Rive <em class="italic">and</em>
Marcet.</h5>—The principle on which these philosophers proceeded in
their researches, was, to expose equal volumes of different gases
to an equal source of heat during equal times, and to judge, by the
augmentation of elastic force in each gas, the temperature which it
had acquired. The apparatus was a kind of manometer, and consisted
of a glass balloon to retain the gas, and a bent tube attached to
it, which, descending into a vessel of mercury, served to show, by
the column of metal within it, what was the elasticity of the gas.
This method was adopted, because, i. The gas was not altered in
volume by the change of temperature, its elasticity only changing:
ii. The temperature was indicated by the gas itself, and not by a
thermometer: iii. Water was easily separated previously from the
gases, and excluded from the apparatus: iv. All the gases were placed
in exactly the same circumstances, so as to render it unnecessary to
refer to any calculation for the purpose of comparison.</div>

<p>Two methods of applying heat were resorted to: in one the balloon,
containing the gas at a certain temperature, was placed in water at
a higher but constant degree, for a certain time (generally
<span class="nowrap">4′),</span>
and the elevation of temperature noticed: in the other, the balloon
with the gas was inclosed in a larger copper balloon, blackened
inside, and the space between the two exhausted as much as possible
of air; the apparatus being then immersed in warm water, the heat
gained access slowly to the gas, and the time of each experiment
was increased, at the same time that certain sources of error were
avoided.</p>

<p>The gases experimented with were, atmospheric air, oxygen, azote,
hydrogen, carbonic acid, olefiant gas, oxide of carbon, nitrous
oxide, nitrous gas, sulphuretted hydrogen, ammonia, sulphurous
acid, muriatic acid, and cyanogen. Great care was taken in their
preparation. The result of the experiment was very unexpected; for,
during the five minutes allotted for each, all had acquired the same
temperature,—a circumstance which proves that they all have the
<em class="italic">same specific heat</em>. The equal volumes of gas at the pressure of
65 centimeters (15.59 inches) and the temperature of <span class="nowrap">20° C.,</span> being
exposed to a source of heat at <span class="nowrap">30° C.,</span> acquired a mean temperature
of 6.32 degrees in five minutes, the extreme difference, in any of
the experiments, not being more than 0.04 of a
<span class="xxpn" id="p201">[p201]</span>
degree. One gas
only forms an exception to the above statement, namely, hydrogen,
which was always heated more than the others, namely, to 6.6 degrees
in the five minutes. This effect is considered as due not to any
difference in specific heat, but to a difference in conducting power.</p>

<p>Experiments were then made with dilated gases, to ascertain whether
dilatation caused any change in capacity, and it was found to
diminish slowly but regularly with the diminution of pressure. These
results, with a third which is also interesting, have been thus
generally expressed by the authors at the end of their memoir.</p>

<p>i. All gases in equal volumes, and at the same pressure, have the
same specific heat.</p>

<p>ii. Other circumstances being the same, the specific heat of gases
diminishes with diminution of pressure, and equally for all the
gases: the progression converges slightly and in a ratio much less
than that of the pressures.</p>

<p>iii. Each gas has a different conducting power, <em class="italic">i.e.</em>, all the gases
have not the some power of communicating or receiving heat.—<em class="italic">Ann. de

by Lieutenant Drummond upon the light of lime and other earths when
highly ignited, with the highly interesting application which he has
made of that emitted from lime, to the purpose of geodesical surveys,
has induced M. Pleischel to repeat and vary the results. He states
that the utmost light is given by lime; the earth being pulverised
and exposed on burning charcoal to the heat excited by a jet of
oxygen falling upon it. He endeavours to account for the effect, by
supposing a kind of pulverulent atmosphere disengaged from the lime
at the high temperature used, and considers that the substances which
are competent to emit molecules only in the gaseous state, cannot
produce this intense light.—<em class="italic">Zeitschrift für

that all the phenomena of this kind are subject to this condition.
If, for instance, two portions of the same metal being put in
contact, electricity is produced, it is because there are three
different states of temperature brought into play, one being the
result of the other two, and a mean between them. One fact which more
than any other sanctioned this idea, was, that the electric <span

the present called a <em class="italic">sideroscope</em>. Its use
is exactly the same in principle as that of the magnetic needle,
indicating iron, for instance, by the attraction manifested; but
it is so delicate that it will show it in the most minute quantity
possible, as, for instance, in gold, silver, or copper money,
innumerable minerals, &#38;c. This instrument shows no magnetic
power or attraction in gold, silver, copper, palladium, tin, lead,
zinc, or brass, when chemically pure, and a great many vegetable
and mineral substances have no action on it: but the most curious
result is, that very pure bismuth and even that of commerce has a <em

to be independent of any magnetic <em class="italic">polarity</em>,
is the first fact of the kind that has been made known. Antimony also
presents the same phenomenon.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>6. <em class="italic">Diminished Solubility of
Substances by Heat</em>.</h5>—Mr. Graham has added one to the few facts
of this kind with which we were acquainted, and has accompanied its
description with some very interesting considerations, which may be
found at length in the Philosophical Magazine, N. S., ii. 20. The
salt experimented with by Mr. Graham is the phosphate of magnesia;
which may be prepared by mixing a solution of 21 parts of phosphate
of soda with one of 15.375 parts of sulphate of magnesia: within 24
hours the phosphate of magnesia precipitates in acicular crystals;
they should be agitated with repeated portions of water, then thrown
upon a filter with more water, and left to dry.</div>

<p>Solutions were obtained by occasionally agitating this salt with
water in the proportion of 2 ounces to a pint of the fluid, for
four days; being then decanted and filtered, they had a sweetish
taste. A quantity of this fluid being heated in a water-bath, became
turbid before the temperature had attained
<span class="nowrap">120° F.;</span> at <span class="nowrap">212°</span>
a cloudy
precipitate slowly subsided, and the supernatant fluid became nearly
transparent. The precipitate was found to be anhydrous phosphate of
magnesia; and, by further experiment, the difference in solubility
was found to be such, that water at 45°, dissolving
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">744</span></span>th</span>
part its
weight of the anhydrous salt, water at 212° only dissolved
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">1151</span></span>th</span>
part. When in the state of crystals, or as hydrate, the proportions
of salt were <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">322</span></span>
and <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">498</span></span> to 1 of water.</p>

<p>Mere continuance of the heat had no effect in increasing the
precipitate either of this salt, or from aqueous solution of lime,
provided no part of the solution was at any time converted into
vapour; but if the solution only occupied a small part of the vessel,
and ebullition came on, then, although all the water might be
returned to the solution, yet the precipitation went on, and might
be
<span class="xxpn" id="p203">[p203]</span>
increased <em class="italic">ad libitum</em>, particularly in the case of lime
water. The cause of the precipitate appears to be the same in all
these cases. The moment a drop of the solution is converted into
vapour, it deposits the quantity of lime or salt which it held in
solution; and in the case of bodies which dissolve so sparingly and
with so much difficulty, although the water be returned again to the
solution, it is incapable of re-dissolving what it has deposited. We
know that it would be a hopeless task to form a saturated solution of
lime by agitating with the water no more than the few grains which
it is capable of dissolving; and in the case of ebullition, when the
lime is once deposited, there should be the same difficulty in taking
it up.</p>

<p>Mr. Graham states that he has observed this effect not only in
lime-water and in solution of phosphate of magnesia, but to a certain
extent in all bodies of difficult solubility, in the sulphate of
lime, for instance, even when greatly diluted; and he believes that
the deposite from slight boiling observed in many mineral waters,
and generally attributed to the dissipation of carbonic acid gas,
depends, in some instances, upon this cause. However weak the
solution may be, it is evident that a portion of the salt may be
deposited in this way.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>7. <em class="italic">On the Composition of
Cyanic Acid</em>.</h5>—M. Wohler some time since announced the production
of cyanic acid, and cyanates, corresponding in composition to the
substance presumed to exist in the fulminating compounds of silver,
mercury, &#38;c., the nature of which was made out by <span class="allcaps">MM</span>. Liebig and
Gay Lussac. M. Liebig, upon repeating M. Wohler’s experiments upon
his cyanate of silver, obtained only 71.012 per cent. of oxide of
silver, instead of 77.23, which was the quantity present according to
M. Wohler’s analysis, and concluded that the acid was the cyanous,
and not the cyanic. The latter philosopher was consequently induced
to repeat his experiments: one of his methods of decomposing the
cyanate of silver was by muriatic acid gas: at first liquid cyanic
acid forms, which is very soon transformed into a white crystalline
mass; but, on continuing the operation, and applying a higher heat,
a large quantity of muriate of ammonia and cyanic acid is evolved.
This process indicated 77.5 per cent. of oxide of silver in the salt.
Another process consisted in dissolving the cyanate in nitric acid,
and precipitating the silver by muriatic acid, the result was 77.05
of oxide per cent. A third analysis, made by reducing the silver of
the salt, gave a result of 77.35 per cent. oxide. The mean of these
is 77.3, and the theoretical number obtained by calculation is 77.23,
so that the acid appears to be truly the cyanic; and the curious fact
of its being the same in composition with that in the fulminating
compounds of silver and mercury, but very unlike in properties, still
remains undisturbed.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em>, A. viii.

by proper tests is found to be a mixture of chloride and iodide of
sodium.</div>

prepared the former of them by passing chlorine gas into alcohol.
The muriatic acid was then separated by distilling the fluid from
off chalk, in which operation the muriatic ether and alcohol passed
over together, and these were divided by the addition of water, which
dissolved the latter, and left the former. The chloric ether was made
as usual from chlorine and olefiant gases. The results that were
obtained by acting on these substances by a high temperature, potash,
phosphorus, &#38;c., induced M. Vogel to consider them as identical
in composition, notwithstanding some differences in their physical
properties; the specific gravity of the muriatic ether was 1.134,
that of the chloric ether 1.214, and the odour of the latter is more
aromatic, and the taste more sweet than of the former.</div>

<p>Whilst passing the chlorine into the alcohol, M. Vogel observed
<span class="xxpn" id="p205">[p205]</span> that if the sun shone
upon the substances when the action was nearly complete, each bubble
of chlorine as it entered the alcohol produced a bright purple
flame, a dense white vapour, and caused violent concussions in the
liquid; another curious instance, in addition to the many that
are known, of the power of solar light over chemical action.—<em

Liebig, for the detection of this substance, which it will effect,
he says, when there is not more than a four-hundredth part of the
acid present. The liquid to be examined must be mixed with sufficient
sulphuric solution of indigo to acquire a distinct blue colour, a few
drops of sulphuric acid added, and the whole boiled. If the liquid
contains a nitrate, it will be bleached, or, if the quantity is very
small, rendered yellow. By adding a little muriate of soda to the
liquid before applying heat, a five-hundredth of nitric acid may
easily be discovered.—<em class="italic">Ann. de Chimie</em>, xxxv.

they were found penetrated with, and covered by, an immense number
of minute crystals of nitre. The oxalic and malic acids had been
replaced by nitric acid; but whether from animalized matter naturally

<div class="h5d"><h5>13. <em class="italic">Experiments on Fluoric
Acid and Fluates, by</em> M. Kuhlman.</h5>—These
experiments were made with dry sulphuric acid and fluor spar, with
the intention of proving that fluor spar is truly a compound of
fluorine and calcium, and not of fluoric acid and oxide of calcium.
A quantity of anhydrous sulphuric acid was prepared with great care,
and collected in a glass tube; the latter was then connected with
a platina tube charged with fluor spar, which had previously been
calcined in a platina crucible, and a glass tube was connected with
the other end of the platina tube for the purpose of conducting and
facilitating the collection of the gas evolved over mercury. The
fluor spar was heated to redness, and then the temperature of the
sulphuric acid raised so as to cause a stream of it in vapour to
pass over the fluor spar; but there was not the slightest reaction,
the sulphuric acid recondensed in part in the farthest tube, and no
trace of fluoric acid was produced. Dry sulphuric acid was then put,
in the liquid state, in contact with dry fluor spar, but there was
no decomposition, and no portion of the spar was converted
<span class="xxpn" id="p206">[p206]</span>
into sulphate of lime. The first experiment was then repeated, with
the difference of using hydrated sulphuric acid of specific gravity
1.842, and there was instantly much fluoric acid produced, which
acted upon the glass.</div>

<p>As Berzelius found 100 parts of fluor spar, when acted upon by
sulphuric acid, to yield 175 parts of sulphate of lime, equal to
73.553 parts of lime, or 52.819 of calcium, it follows that 100
parts of fluoride of calcium should contain 47.181 of fluorine and
52.819 of calcium. By the assistance of this result, and further
experiments, M. Kuhlman proceeded to ascertain the composition of
hydro-fluoric acid. Dry muriatic acid gas was passed over calcined
fluor spar heated to redness in a tube of platina; the fluoride of
calcium was decomposed, free hydro-fluoric acid was evolved, and
chloride of lime remained in the tube. The hydro-fluoric acid acted
upon the glass tubes, but being received in water was entirely
dissolved, with the exception of the silica it had separated from
the glass: no trace of hydrogen appeared. One hundred parts of
fluoride of calcium thus treated became 143.417 parts of chloride of
calcium, the 52.819 parts of calcium having united to 90.598 parts of
chlorine. But this latter quantity must have liberated 2.511 parts of
hydrogen, which must, therefore, have combined with the 47.181 parts
of fluorine in the spar, to form 49.692 parts of hydro-fluoric acid.
This latter body, therefore, consists of 94.941 fluorine, and 5.059
of hydrogen per cent. A small quantity of chlorine was set at liberty
during the experiment, the author thinks, from a little manganese in
the fluor spar.</p>

<p>M. Kuhlman found that all the chlorides, when subjected to the action
of anhydrous sulphuric acid in vapour, resisted decomposition, except
the chloride of sodium, which gave a small quantity of sulphate of
soda, and a double salt of soda and platina, crystallizing in fine
needles of a yellow colour. No doubt is entertained that, in the
latter case, the common salt and sulphuric acid were not perfectly
dry.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em></p>

that the power which they ordinarily possess is instantaneously
destroyed by the addition of small quantities only of certain other
substances, as the essential oils. The rectified oils of turpentine

of anniseed, cajeput, lavender, rue, sassafras, fern, cascarilla,

has remarked, that brass on brass can inflame powder, and has made
experiments on the subject before a committee, the result of which
is as follows:—Inflammation of the powder takes place when the blow
is given by iron against iron; iron against brass; brass against
brass; iron against marble; lead against lead, or against wood,
when the blow is produced by a leaden ball shot from a fire-arm.

Cast Iron</em>.</h5>—Pure iron, when surrounded by, and in contact with,
cast iron turnings, and heated, is carbonised very rapidly, so as
to harden, to temper, and, in fact, to exhibit all the properties
of steel. M. Gautier finds this a very advantageous process in
numerous cases, especially where the articles to be case-hardened,
or converted into steel, are small, as iron wire, or wire gauze. The
temperature required is not so high as that necessary in the ordinary
process of cementation, and the pieces to be carbonised are not
injured in form. The kind of cast iron used should be the gray metal,
and the more minutely it is divided the more rapid and complete is
the operation. By covering the mass of cast metal, in which the iron
to be carbonised is enveloped, with sand, oxidation, from contact of
the air, is prevented, and the cast metal may be used many times.
Plumbago experimented with in the same manner does not produce the

cyanogen, and gave a ferro-prussiate. The following is the process
of manufacture to which M. Gautier has ultimately arrived,
<span class="xxpn" id="p208">[p208]</span>
and which he has practised for some years. The proportions of the
materials are—</div>

</table></div>

<p>The blood is first to be coagulated in a large copper cauldron, and
the serum being separated by means of a press, the coagulum is to be
returned to the cauldron with the nitre and iron. The quantity of
water contained in the blood is sufficient to liquify the salt, so as
to allow of an uniform mixture being effected. The mixture is then
removed, and exposed in an airy situation to dry, the putrefaction
of the blood being prevented by the nitre. When the desiccation is
complete, the mixture is charged into cast iron cylinders, which are
fixed in a reverberatory furnace, and in all things resemble those
used in the preparation of animal charcoal. These are to be raised to
a brown red heat, until no more vapour is disengaged, and then left
until nearly cold, after which the contents are to be withdrawn and
put into a wooden vat, with twelve or fifteen times their weight of
water, for an hour. The fluid is then to be filtered through a cloth,
and evaporated until of 32° of Beaué (specific gravity 1.284.) Being
then left to cool, a large quantity of well-crystallized bi-carbonate
of potash is obtained. M. Gautier says he has not, as yet, been
able to explain how it is that this bi-carbonate has been formed
at so high a temperature; a portion also appears to be decomposed
during the evaporation of the solution, which, at first but slightly
alkaline, becomes sensibly so by a prolonged evaporation.</p>

<p>As the same product is not obtained when potash is used in place of
nitre, it is probable that the elements of the nitric acid perform a
particular part in the operation.</p>

<p>The solution which has given the crystals of carbonate of potash
contains a little carbonate of potash, and much ferro-prussiate of
potash. It is to be concentrated to 34° (specific gravity 1.306), and
placed in wooden vessels lined with lead. In the course of some days
a greenish crystalline mass is obtained, which being redissolved in a
fresh quantity of pure water, and evaporated to 32° or 33° (specific
gravity 1.295), is to be recrystallized.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when using potash, M. Gautier has mixed nitre with it,
and has always obtained a richer product than when potash alone had
been employed.—<em class="italic">Jour. de Phar.</em> 1827, p. 11.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>21. <em class="italic">Separation of Arsenic
from Nickel or Cobalt</em>.</h5>—The following process by M. Woehler seems
among the best of those intended for freeing nickel or cobalt from
arsenic in the dry way. It is founded upon the circumstances that
many alloys, when heated with sulphuret of potash, become changed
into a mixture of sulphurets, and that sulphuret of arsenic is very
soluble in sulphuret of potash. One part of kupfernickle, fused and
reduced to fine powder, is to be mixed with 3 parts of carbonate of
potash, and 3 parts of sulphur, in a covered Hessian crucible. The
heat is to be gradually raised to redness, and until the mass is
just entering into fusion, and by no means so highly as to fuse the
sulphuret of nickel which is formed. When cold, water is to be added,
which will dissolve the sulphuret of potash, and leave a yellow
crystalline powder, which is sulphuret of nickel, retaining, perhaps,
a little copper or cobalt, but no arsenic, if the operation has been
well performed. When, however, the object is to have the nickel
perfectly pure, it should be fused a second time with sulphur and
potash.</div>

<p>The method of freeing cobalt from arsenic, is the same as for
nickel; but it is then necessary to perform the operation a second
time. The cobalt (that of Tunaberg) has never been perfectly freed
from arsenic by one operation, but has never retained any after the
second.—<em class="italic">Archiv für Bergbau</em>, 1826, p. 186.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>24. <em class="italic">On the Bitter
Substance produced by the action of Nitric Acid on
Indigo, Silk, and Aloes</em>, <em class="italic">by</em> M. Just
Liebeg.</h5>—The process by which
M. Liebeg obtains a pure and uniform substance from the action of
nitric acid on indigo, is as follows:—A portion of the best indigo
is to be broken into small fragments, and moderately heated with
eight or ten times its weight of nitric acid of moderate strength.
It will dissolve, evolving an abundance of nitrous vapours and
swelling up in the vessel. After the scum has fallen, the liquid is
to be boiled, and nitric acid added, whilst any disengagement of red
vapours is occasioned by it. When the liquid has become cold, a large
quantity of semi-transparent yellow crystals will be formed, and if
the operation has been well conducted, no artificial tannin or resin
will be obtained. The crystals are to be washed with cold water, and
then boiled in water sufficient to dissolve them. If any oily drops
of tannin form on the surface of the solution, they must be carefully
removed by touching them with filtering paper. Then filtering the
fluid, and allowing it to cool, yellow brilliant crystalline plates
will be obtained, which will not lose their lustre by washing.</div>

<p>To obtain the substance perfectly pure, the crystals must be
re-dissolved in boiling water, and neutralized by carbonate of
potash. Upon cooling, a salt of potash will crystallize, which should
be purified by repeated crystallizations.</p>

<p>On mixing the first mother liquor with water, a considerable brown
precipitate will be obtained, which being dissolved in boiling
<span class="xxpn" id="p211">[p211]</span>
water, and neutralized by carbonate of potash, will furnish
a large quantity of the potash salt. All the potash salt obtained
in these operations is to be re-dissolved in boiling water, and
nitric, muriatic, or sulphuric acid added; as the solution cools, the
peculiar substance will be observed to form very brilliant plates of
a clear yellow colour, generally in equilateral triangular forms.</p>

<p>Sometimes crystals are not formed after the action of the nitric acid
on the indigo, in which case the liquor must be evaporated, and water
added, when the substance will precipitate, and must be purified
as already described. Four parts of indigo yield one of the pure
substance.</p>

<p>When the substance is heated, it fuses, and is volatilized without
decomposition; when subjected to a sudden strong heat, it inflames
without explosion, its vapours burning with a yellow flame, and a
carbonaceous residue remaining. It is but little soluble in cold
water, but much more in boiling water; the solution has a bright
yellow colour, reddens litmus, has an extremely bitter taste, and
acts like a strong acid on metallic oxides, dissolving them, and
forming peculiar crystallizable salts.—Ether and alcohol dissolve
the substance readily.</p>

<p>When fused in chlorine or with iodine, it is not decomposed, nor does
solution of chlorine affect it. Cold sulphuric acid has no action
on it; when hot, it dissolves it, but water separates the substance
without alteration. Boiling muriatic acid does not affect it, and
nitro-muriatic acid only with great difficulty.</p>

<p>These results show that no nitric acid is present in the substance,
and other experiments prove that no oxide of nitrogen exists in it;
it contains no oxalic or other organic acid, for when its salt is
boiled with chloride of gold, the latter is not reduced.</p>

<p>When heated to redness with oxide of copper, it gave a mixture of
nitrogen and carbonic acid, in the exact proportion of 1 volume of
the former, to 5 of the latter. This was a constant result, and in no
case was any sulphuric or muriatic acid left in the copper. 0.0625
grammes of the substance thus decomposed, gave 45 cubic centimeters
of the mixed gases, estimated at 0° C. (32° F.) and the pressure of
28 inches of mercury, according to which the acid would be composed
of carbon 32.392; nitrogen 15.2144; oxygen 52.3936 per cent. From the

<p><em class="italic">Welter’s bitter principle</em> was prepared by acting on silk with ten

the salt of potash thus obtained, decomposed by muriatic, nitric, or
sulphuric acid. This acid, crystallized like that from indigo, formed
the same salts, and was composed in the same manner. Silk furnishes
much less of the substance than indigo. Dr. Liebeg has called this
substance <em class="italic">carbazotic acid</em>. The most important salts formed by it
have the following
<span class="nowrap">properties:—</span></p>

<p><em class="italic">Carbazotate of Potash</em>—crystallizes in long yellow quadrilateral
needles, semi-transparent and very brilliant; it dissolves in
260 parts of water at 59° F., and in much less, boiling water: a
saturated boiling solution becomes a yellow mass of needles, from
which scarcely any fluid will run. Strong acids decompose it;
yet when an alcoholic solution of carbazotic acid is added to a
solution of nitre, crystallized carbazotate of potash, after some
time, precipitates.—Alcohol does not dissolve it. When a little
is gradually heated in a glass tube, it first fuses, and then
suddenly explodes, breaking the tube to atoms; traces of charcoal
are observed on the fragments. This salt precipitates a solution
of the protonitrate of mercury, but not salts, containing the
peroxide, or those of copper, lead, cobalt, iron, lime, baryta,
strontia, or magnesia. The slight solubility of this salt supplies
an easy method of testing and separating potash in a fluid. Even
the potash in tincture of litmus may be discovered by it; for, on
adding a few drops of carbazotic acid, dissolved in alcohol, to
infusion of litmus, crystals of the salt gradually separated. The
saturated solution of the salt at 50° F., is not troubled by muriate
of platina. The salt contains no water of crystallization. It was

<p><em class="italic">Carbazotate of Silver</em>.—Carbazotic acid readily dissolves oxide of
silver, when heated with it and water; and the solution, gradually
evaporated, yields starry groups of fine acicular crystals of the
colour and lustre of gold; the salt dissolves readily in water; when
heated to a certain degree, it does not detonate, but fuses like
gunpowder.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Proto-Carbazotate of Mercury</em>, obtained in small yellow triangular
crystals, by mixing boiling solutions of the carbazotate of potash or
soda, and proto-nitrate of mercury. It requires more than 1200 parts
of water for its solution: for its perfect purification, it should
be heated with a solution of chloride of potassium, the insoluble
portion separated whilst the liquid is lost, and the peculiar salt
allowed to deposit as the temperature falls. When heated, it behaves
like the salt of silver.</p>

<p>All these salts detonate much more powerfully when heated in close
vessels, than when heated in the air; and it was a curious thing to
observe, that those with bases yielding oxygen most readily, were
those which exploded with least force. By heating some of the salts
previously mixed with chloride of potassium, &#38;c., to retard the
action, it appeared that no carbonic oxide, but only carbonic

acid and azote were evolved during their decomposition by heat.</p>

<p><em class="italic">On the Bitter Principle from Aloes</em>.—Upon distilling 8 parts
of nitric acid from 1 part of the extract of aloes, and adding
water to the remaining fluid, a resinous reddish yellow substance
precipitated, which, by washing, became pulverulent—it was
discovered by M. Braconnot. Upon evaporating the liquid separated
from the precipitate, it gave large yellow rhomboidal crystals,
not transparent, and but slightly soluble. These crystals, at
first mistaken for a particular substance, were soon found to be
a combination of oxalic acid with the bitter of aloes. The bitter
substances of aloes dissolved in 800 parts of water, at 59° F., but
in a smaller quantity of boiling water. This solution has a superb
purple colour. Silk boiled in it acquired a very fine purple colour,
on which neither soap nor acids effected any change, except nitric
acid; this changed the colour to yellow, but it was restored simply
by washing in water. All shades may be given to this colour by proper
mordants. Wool is dyed black in a peculiarly beautiful manner, by
the same process, and light has no influence on the colour. Leather
acquires a purple colour; cotton, a rose colour; but the latter will
not resist soap. Dr. Liebeg thinks that this is the only substance
from which a permanent rose dye for silk may be expected.—<em class="italic">Ann. de

These crystals are really very regular tetraedrons. In many plants,

of Litmus as a Test</em>, <em class="italic">by</em> M. Magnus.</h5>—When
pure water is heated for a sufficient time with infusion of litmus,
reddened by an acid, it restores the blue colour. It is supposed
that the heat gradually causes the free sulphuric acid, which had
occasioned the reddening, to combine with the excess of alkali
contained in the infusion, and thus to cause the restoration of the
blue colour. Hence this preparation cannot be used to test the
<span class="xxpn" id="p215">[p215]</span>

anticipated from the alkali. The earthy salts contained in ordinary
water also produce this effect.—<em class="italic">Jour. de

no precipitation of the colouring matter takes place, the latter
remaining dissolved by the potash—iv. That the acetate of lead should

capable of producing various colours with wines of a natural colour
only—v. That the same is the case with lime-water, with muriate of

may be employed for this purpose, the changes of colour which it
produces not perceptibly varying—vii. That the same is the case

<div class="h5d"><h5>28. <em class="italic">Test of the Presence
of Opium</em>.</h5>—Dr. Hare says he can detect opium in solution, when
the quantity is not more than that given, by adding ten drops of
laudanum to half a gallon of water. The following is the process:—a
few drops of solution of acetate of lead is to be added to the
solution containing the drug; after some time an observable quantity
of meconiate of lead will fall down: from six to twelve hours may
sometimes be required, and the precipitation is best effected in a
conical glass vessel, for then, by gentle stirring now and then to
liberate that which adheres to the side, the insoluble salt may be
collected together at the bottom. About thirty drops of sulphuric
acid are then to be poured on to the meconiate by means of a glass
tube, after which as much of a solution of red sulphate of iron is
to be added in the same manner. The sulphuric acid will liberate
the meconic acid, and thus enable it to produce with the iron the
appropriate colour, which demonstrates the presence of that acid, and
consequently of opium.—<em class="italic">Silliman’s Journal</em>,

<div class="h5d"><h5>29. <em class="italic">Denarcotized
Laudanum</em>.</h5>—Thinking it important to ascertain whether, by the
removal of narcotine from opium, the unpleasant effects which,
according to the opinions at present entertained upon that subject,
are produced by that drug would be removed, Dr. Hare prepared some
opium with ether, guided by Robiquet’s statement that narcotine
was soluble in that fluid: the opium was shaved by rubbing it on
the face of a jack-plane, and subjected four times successively
to as much ether of the specific gravity 0.735 as would cover
it, the operation being performed in a small Papin’s digester,
at a temperature near the boiling point of ether, and each <span
class="xxpn" id="p216">[p216]</span> portion of the fluid being
allowed twenty-four hours for its action. A crystalline deposition
was soon observed in the ether which had been removed from the opium,
and, allowing the stopper of the vessel to remain out, nearly the
whole of the liquid evaporated in a few days, and left much coloured
crystalline matter. This, Dr. Hare has no doubt, was narcotine in an
impure state. The opium was afterwards subjected to as much alcohol
as would have been required to convert it into laudanum, had it been
in the ordinary state; and this being administered medicinally,
was found to occasion none of those uneasy and unpleasant
sensations which often follow the use of ordinary opium.—<em

<div class="h5d"><h5>30. <em class="italic">Extraction of Morphia
from Dry Poppy Heads</em>, by M. Tilloy.</h5>—Make an aqueous extract
of the heads, add alcohol to the extract, separate the alcoholic
solution, and distil it; by this means the gummy matter is separated.
An extract like syrup will be obtained by the distillation, which,
being heated to make it thinner, and of the consistency of treacle,
is to be again treated with alcohol; a separation of more gum,
with much nitrate of potash, will be effected. The solution being
withdrawn, is to be distilled, and the extract which will remain is
to be acted upon by a sufficient quantity of water, and filtered,
to separate the resinous matter present. The morphia may then be
separated from this liquid, either by ammonia, carbonate of soda, or
magnesia. Ammonia does not precipitate all the morphia; carbonate
of soda precipitates a large quantity, but, it separates resinous
matter also, which is found mingled with the morphia. Magnesia is
preferable; but as the liquid contains much free acetic acid, it is
expensive to employ the necessary quantity of pure magnesia: the
liquid may, therefore, be partly saturated, whilst hot, by carbonate
of magnesia, or even by carbonate of lime. A judgment, when no more
must be added, must be formed from the effervescence; then pure
magnesia is to be added, which will cause the liberation of ammonia;
the whole is to be left for twenty-four hours to cool: being then
filtered, the precipitate is to be washed, and, when dry, acted upon
by alcohol. Operating in this manner, morphia may be obtained from
all kinds of poppies.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em> E. viii.

<div class="h5d"><h5>31. <em class="italic">Preparation of
Morphia</em>.</h5>—Some curious experiments have been described to the
Académie de Médecine, by M. Robinet, relative to the preparation of
morphia. Having operated on the residue of opium by muriatic acid,
and precipitated the morphia from the muriatic solution by lime, he
wished to ascertain whether the mother liquor contained any morphia
that had escaped precipitation. He, therefore, passed a current of
carbonic acid gas through the solution, to precipitate the lime in
excess: this precipitate being washed, dried, and acted upon by
alcohol, was found mixed with a very large proportion of morphia,
which could <span class="xxpn" id="p217">[p217]</span> be thus
separated. The washings of the precipitate being examined, were found
free from morphia.</div>

<p>M. Henry observed, at the same time, that, from experiments
made at La Pharmacie Centrale, it appeared that much more morphia
was obtained in those processes in which lime had been used to
precipitate the morphia, than in those in which magnesia had been
used.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em> C. xi. 225.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>32. <em class="italic">Easy Method of obtaining
Meconic Acid</em>, by Dr. Hare.</h5>—If to an aqueous infusion of opium
we add subacetate of lead, a copious precipitation of meconiate
of lead ensues: this being collected by a filter, and exposed to
sulphuretted hydrogen, meconic acid is liberated: the solution is of
a reddish amber colour, and furnishes, by evaporation, crystals of
the same hue. A very small quantity produces a very striking effect
in reddening solution of peroxide of iron. Instead of sulphuretted
hydrogen, sulphuric acid may be used to liberate the meconic acid:
the presence of the former in excess does not seem to interfere with
the power of reddening ferruginous solutions, but any excess of
sulphuric acid may be removed by whitening, which is not acted upon
sensibly by meconic acid; Yet, the acid procured in this way did not
crystallize so handsomely, or with so much facility, as that obtained
by sulphuretted hydrogen.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>33. <em class="italic">On a New Vegetable
Acid</em>.</h5>—This acid is crystallizable, but the forms have not as yet
been determined: it is less soluble in cold water than tartaric acid;
its aqueous solution precipitates lime water in white floculi, just
like tartaric acid, but the precipitate, if dissolved in muriatic
acid, re-appears on adding ammonia, whilst that produced by tartaric
acid does not produce this effect. The new acid has a greater
affinity for lime than muriatic or nitric acids, for it precipitates
the muriate and nitrate of this earth in the manner of oxalic acid,
but it differs from the latter in not precipitating a solution of
sulphate of lime. With potash it forms an acid salt, slightly soluble
in cold water: it precipitates acetate of lead, and the precipitate
holds much water in combination: the tartrate of lead, on the
contrary, is anhydrous. Notwithstanding these circumstances, the
equivalent number of this acid is within a few thousandths of that of
tartaric acid: when distilled, it is decomposed, and produces an acid
yellow liquid like tartaric acid, leaving a light charcoal burning
without residuum. M. Gay Lussac is engaged in developing the chemical
history of this substance.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em> A.

<div class="h5d"><h5>34. <em class="italic">Altheine, a new
Vegetable Principle</em>.</h5>—M. Bacon gives the following directions
for the preparation of this substance, which he has discovered in
the <em class="italic">Althea officinalis</em>. An extract of the
roots of the plant is to be made by means of cold water, and, when
concentrated, <span class="xxpn" id="p218">[p218]</span> acted upon
by boiling alcohol: the latter will dissolve the acid malate of
altheine, oil, &#38;c.: the different alcoholic decoctions are to
be put together and will throw down a crystalline deposite as they
cool; the latter is to be separated and dissolved in water, and the
solution, when filtered, is to be evaporated by a moderate heat,
until like a syrup, and then set aside to crystallize. The crystals
procured are to be washed with a small quantity of pure water, to
separate the yellow matter from them, and then dried upon paper.
These crystals appear, to the naked eye, like grains, needles, and
feathers, but under the microscope present a hexaedral form. They are
of a fine emerald green colour, transparent, brilliant, inodorous;
unaltered in the air; they redden litmus paper, are soluble in water,
and insoluble in alcohol. The aqueous solution of these crystals,
acted upon by cold magnesia and filtered, then restores the colour
of reddened litmus paper; renders syrup of violets green; and when
evaporated furnishes the altheine free from malic acid. When thus
pure, the substance crystallizes in regular hexaedral forms or
in rhomboidal octoedrons; it affects litmus and violets as just
described: it is transparent, of an emerald green colour, brilliant,
inodorous, slightly sapid, unaltered by air, very soluble in water,
not soluble in alcohol, soluble in acetic acid, with which it forms
a crystalline salt.—<em class="italic">Ann. de Chimie</em>, xxxiv.

<div class="h5d"><h5>35. <em class="italic">Rheine, a new

rhubarb with 8 parts of nitric acid, s. g. 1.32, at a moderate
temperature, reducing the whole to the consistence of syrup, and
then diffusing it through water, M. Vaudin obtained a precipitate
which possessed peculiar characters, and to which he gave the name
of <em class="italic">Rheine</em>. When dry, it is of an orange
yellow colour, without any particular odour, and slightly bitter. It
dissolves in water as well as in alcohol and ether: the solutions
become yellow by acids, and rose red by alkalis. It burns nearly in
the manner of amadou. Rhubarb acted upon by ether only gave a similar
substance, a circumstance which proves that Rheine exists ready
formed in rhubarb, and that it is not acted upon by nitric acid.—<em

<div class="h5d"><h5>36. <em class="italic">On Dragon’s Blood, and
a new Substance which it contains</em>, <em class="italic">by</em>
M. Melandri.</h5>—Pure dragon’s blood is, according to M. Melandri,
a scarce substance; the drops in which it occurs are rarely
transparent, generally opaque, and with a rough fracture: its colour
is blood red. Besides being soluble in alcohol it is entirely soluble
in oil and also in hot water, though a large quantity of the latter
fluid is required for the purpose. The aqueous solution is bitter,
astringent, and of a fine purple colour; by cooling, it becomes milky
and red. Gelatine does not alter its appearance; a proof that the
substance contains no tannin. Sulphate of iron forms a pale reddish
precipitate, so that no evidence of gallic acid is afforded. <span
class="xxpn" id="p219">[p219]</span></div>

<p>Supposing that this substance might contain a principle analogous to
that latterly observed by M. Pelletier in logwood, &#38;c. a portion of
it was dissolved in strong alcohol, the solution evaporated until
very concentrated, and then poured into cold water, an agglomerated
spongy substance was precipitated, which, after being washed with
cold water and filtered, was triturated with water containing
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">100</span></span>th</span>
of sulphuric acid, and exhibited traces of chemical action
at a temperature of 22° (61°.6 F.) It then deposited a substance
upon the sides of the vessel, and the liquid became yellow and very
acid. The sediment, being carefully washed with water, was of a fine
red colour, varying according to the state of aggregation; it had
no taste or smell; was flexible between the fingers, and was quite
fluid at 55° (131° F.). This substance, which the author has called
<em class="italic">Dracine</em>, has some analogy with the vegeto-alkalis, although its
affinity for acids is but slight. The sulphate may be obtained, he
says, by adding sulphuric acid diluted with alcohol to an alcoholic
solution of <em class="italic">dracine</em>, precipitating the mixture by cold water, and
then applying a little heat; the sulphate of dracine collects at the
bottom, is to be washed with cold water until the latter no longer
reddens litmus paper, and then dissolved in hot water. This solution
becomes red by the smallest quantity of alkalis, and may be used as
a very sensible test of their presence. Dracine is also a good test
for acids, assuming a yellow colour with them. The small quantity of
carbonate of lime in filtering paper may be detected by sulphate of
dracine, the yellow solution instantly becoming red from its action,
and thus showing its presence.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em> C. xi. p. 157.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>37. <em class="italic">Purification of
Madder, by the Separation of its Yellow Colouring Matter</em>.</h5>—The
experiments of <span class="allcaps">MM</span>. Kuhlman, Colin, and Robiquet<a class="fnanchor"

Kurrer to publish the means which he has resorted to for the
purification of madder, by the separation of the yellow colouring
matter from it; and thus rendering it more fit to supply the
various red, lilac, violet, and brown colours which are required
upon wool, silk, cotton and linen. Three tubs or vessels are
placed by the side of each other: in summer they may be in the
open air under shelter, but in the winter should be placed in an
airy cellar where the temperature may be retained at 18° or 20°
R. (73° to 77° F.). The first is that in which the soaking and
fermentation is to be effected: it should be 2 feet 8 inches deep,
and 2 feet 6 inches in diameter, for from fifty to fifty-five
pounds of madder. The second, or washing vessel, should be <span
class="mixfract">5<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span
class="fdn">2</span></span></span> feet deep, and 3 feet in
diameter; it should have three wooden cocks fixed into it, the
first 2 feet, the second 3 feet, and the third 4 feet from the
bottom. The third tub is for deposition; its height should be <span
class="mixfract">4<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span
class="fdn">2</span></span></span> feet, and it should have
a cock at <span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> foot
from the bottom. <span class="xxpn" id="p220">[p220]</span></div>

<p>On commencing the operation, 50 or 55 lb. of pulverised madder are
to be put into the first vessel, water is to be added, and stirred
into the mass until it stands
<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
inch above the madder. The whole
is then to be left until fermentation comes on and has formed a coat
of madder at the surface; this usually takes place in 36 hours,
and at latest in 48 hours, according to the temperature. The mass
should now be transferred into the second vessel, which is then to
be filled with water, and being left for two hours, the madder will
fall to the bottom. The upper cock is then to be opened, after that
the second, and then the third; and the water which runs from the
two latter is to be put into the third vessel, that the rest of the
madder may separate from it. The madder in the second vessel is
then to be washed a second, third, or fourth time until the washing
water is colourless. Thus purified, the madder may be used in the
processes of dyeing, according to the known methods; but it is
important in summer that it should be used immediately, that a new
(the vinous) fermentation may be avoided. The madder deposited in the
third vessel, when washed and deposited, may be used like the rest.
The liquid first separated after the fermentation may be used in
the preparation of hot indigo baths, &#38;c. instead of madder.—<em class="italic">Bull.

parts of hydrate
of lime, and from 50 to 60 parts of water, were digested together
for 24 hours in a close vessel, which had previously been filled
with hydrogen. The clear liquor over the sulphate of lime and
oxide of iron, had a yellowish red colour, and was separated by
a syphon filled with hydrogen, and mixed with diluted muriatic
acid, containing some sulphite of ammonia dissolved; a dense white
precipitate was formed, becoming blue in the air. This was gathered
in a filter without contact of air, and washed with boiled water
containing sulphite of ammonia in solution, and dried at 212°, in
close vessels, through which a current of hydrogen was continually
passed. The upper surface of the mass became of a blue colour, but
the lower remained of a dull white.</div>

<p>This white substance was called Indigogene. It did not change colour
in dry air, but under water became of a deep blue, which by drying,
assumed a coppery appearance. The blue substance volatilized by heat
without leaving any residue, forming purple vapours, which condensed,
when cold, into crystals differing in nothing from sublimed indigo.
<em class="italic">Indigogene</em> dissolves in alkalis without neutralizing them: it is
also soluble in alcohol, but insoluble in water or acids.</p>

<p>A given quantity of this indigogene was acted upon by ammonia, and
the weight of the undissolved blue portion ascertained, it appeared
that the weight of the pure portion dissolved was 0.404 grammes
(6.224 grains.) The solution was put into an inverted
<span class="xxpn" id="p221">[p221]</span>

over mercury, and oxygen gas gradually passed in until absorption
ceased, and then the liquid containing the precipitated indigo was
evaporated to dryness at 212°. The weight of the substance was
increased to 0.047, <em class="italic">i. e.</em> 11.5 per cent.</p>

<p>Not having obtained indigogene <em class="italic">perfectly</em> pure, M. Liebeg did not

produce larger or smaller quantities of acetates, probably, not by
decomposing the sulphuric ether, but the acetic ether which is always
mixed with it; and that it is in consequence of the saturation of
the acetic acid set free from the ether by this decomposition, that
sulphuric ether does not redden litmus paper when evaporated, whereas
it acts differently when being slightly heated, the quantity of

<p>Nitric and acetic ethers are described as being easily decomposed by
the action of many bodies without the assistance of heat, if aided by

Manipulation</em>.</h5>—The kindness of a friend at Bristol has pointed
out to me an error in the directions relative to alkalimetry, which I
have given in the above work: this I am desirous of correcting, and,
by permission of Mr. Brande, have the opportunity of doing so in the
<em class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Science</em>.</div>

<p>The mistake, which arose from using the wrong specific gravity of two
that were required in calculation, occurs in the paragraphs (599,
600,) but fortunately is prevented from occasioning any experimental
error by the directions given in (602). The acid of specific gravity,
1.141, directed to be used, is too strong for the quantities marked
upon the tube. The substitution of one of specific gravity 1.127,
will correct the error, and may be obtained very nearly by mixing 19
parts, by weight, of strong oil of vitriol, with 81 parts of water.</p>

<p>The alterations required may be made in the volume with a pen, as
for errors of the press, by reading “1.127” for “1.141” in lines 25
and 30 of page 276, and lines 2 and 13 of page 277; and “nineteen”
for “one” in line 27, and “eighty-one” for “four” in line 28 of page

<div class="h5d"><h5>1. <em class="italic">On the Supposed Influence
of the Moon</em>, by M. Arago.</h5>—There is an impression very general
with gardeners, that the moon has a particular effect on plants,
especially in certain months. The gardeners near Paris gave the
name of the <em class="italic">lune rousse</em> to the moon, which,
beginning in April, becomes full either at the end of the month, or
more generally in May. According to them the light of the moon, in
the months of April and May, injures the shoots of plants, and that,
when the sky is clear, the leaves and buds exposed to this light
become red or brown, and are killed, though the thermometer in the
atmosphere is several degrees above the freezing point: they confirm
this observation, by remarking that, when the rays of the moon are
stopped in consequence of the existence of clouds in the air, that
then the plants are not injured, although the temperature and other
circumstances are the same.</div>

<p>M. Arago explains this observation of practical men, by a reference
to the facts and principles established by Dr. Wells. He has shown
that, in a clear night, exposed bodies may frequently have their
temperatures reduced below that of the surrounding atmosphere,
solely by the effect of radiation, the difference being as much as
6, 7, 10, or more degrees, but that it does not take place when the
heavens are obscured. M. Arago then observes, that the temperature
is often not more than 4, 5, or 6 degrees above the freezing point
during the nights of April and May, and that when the night is clear,
consequently when the moon is bright, the temperature of the leaves
and buds may often be brought by radiation below the freezing point,
whilst the air remains above it, and consequently an effect be
produced, which, though not dependent upon, accompanies the brilliant
unobscured state of the moon—the absence of these injurious effects,
when the moon is obscured, being also as perfectly accounted for
by these principles, from the knowledge that the same clouds which
obscure the moon will prevent the radiation of heat from the plants.
Hence, as M. Arago observes, the observation of the gardener is
correct as far as it goes, though the interpretation of the effect
which he generally gives is incorrect.—<em class="italic">Annuaire du Bureau des

<div class="h5d"><h5>2. <em class="italic">Luminous Appearances in
the Atmosphere</em>.</h5>—An account is given at page 242 of our last
volume, from Silliman’s Journal, of certain spots in the air near
the horizon, which have been seen highly luminous in Ohio, United
States, by Mr. Atwater, and which often induce the supposition that
fires exist in their direction. Mr. Webster says—“I have observed
similar phenomena in New England: I recollect one instance, when
I resided at Amherst, in Hampshire County, Mass., a bright light
in the north-east, near <span class="xxpn" id="p223">[p223]</span>
the horizon, appeared as the light of a building on fire appears
at night, at the distance of several miles. I expected, in that
instance, every hour to hear that some building in Shutesbury, or
New Salem, had been burnt, and, so strong was my belief of it, that
I repeatedly asked my neighbours whether they had heard of any such
event. At last, I met a gentleman who had just come from one of
those towns, who told me he had heard of no fire from that quarter,
which convinced me the phenomenon was merely atmospheric.”—<em

<em class="italic">Indelible Writing</em>.</h5>—As the art of man can unmake whatever the
art of man can make, we have no right to expect an <em class="italic">indelible ink</em>:
however, a sort of approximation to it may be made as follows:—Let
a saturated solution of indigo and madder in boiling water be made,
in such proportions as give a purple tint; add to it from one sixth
to one eighth of its weight of sulphuric acid, according to the
thickness and strength of the paper to be used: this makes an ink
which flows pretty freely from the pen, and when writing, which has
been executed with it, is exposed to a considerable, but gradual,
heat from the fire, it becomes completely black, the letters being
burnt in and charred by the action of the sulphuric acid. <em class="italic">If the
acid has not been used in sufficient quantity to destroy the texture
of the paper, and reduce it to the state of tinder, the colour may be
discharged by the oxymuriatic and oxalic acids, and their compounds,
though not without great difficulty</em>. When the full proportion of
acid has been employed, a little crumpling and rubbing of the paper
reduces the carbonaceous matter of the letters to powder; but by
putting a black ground behind them, they may be preserved, and thus a
species of <em class="italic">indelible writing</em> is procured, (for the letters are, in
a manner, stamped out of the paper,) which might be useful for some
purposes, perhaps for the signature of bank-notes.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>5. <em class="italic">Peculiar Crystals of Quartz</em>.</h5>—Mr. W. Phillips has met with some
remarkable crystals of quartz, which occurred imbedded in the
<span class="xxpn" id="p224">[p224]</span>
limestone of the Black-rock, near Cork. They are from the fourth
to the half of an inch in length, and about half their length in
width: they are smooth, externally, for the most part, and sometimes
considerably bright; they are of the colour termed smoky, or brown
quartz, externally, and may easily be separated from the limestone,
leaving a cavity of their exact form. On trying to cleave them, they
yielded parallel to one or other of the planes of the pyramid, like
common quartz, but at such fractures appeared to consist of alternate
and concentric prisms of smoky transparent quartz, and of gray
opaque, and somewhat granular limestone. On applying muriatic acid to
the surface, effervescence occurred along the gray parts, proving the
presence of limestone, but soon ceased: after an action continued for
some weeks, the gray parts became cellular, and so soft, as to admit
of being scraped by a knife. Mr. Phillips says, it seems reasonable
to conclude that such part of the gray substance as does not yield to
the action of the acid is siliceous or quartzose; and that the prime
difference between it and the smoky quartz surrounding it consists in
the different circumstances of crystalline aggregation under which
they are deposited. The crystals, with the somewhat analogous case of
the Fontainebleau sandstone, may serve to assist in the illustration
of some points relative to the laws of affinity, as operating in the
formation of crystals.—<em class="italic">Phil. Mag.</em> N. S., ii. 123.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>6. <em class="italic">Native Iron not Meteoric</em>.</h5>—The following notice is by Mr. C.
A. Lee. Native iron, on Canaan mountain, a mile and a half from the
South Meetinghouse (Conn. U. S.). This is particularly interesting,
as it is the first instance in which native iron, not meteoric,
has been found in America. It was discovered by Major Barrall, of
Canaan, while employed in surveying, many years ago. It formed a thin
stratum, or plate, in a mass of mica slate, which seemed to have been
broken from an adjoining ledge. It presents the usual characters of
native iron, and is easily malleable. For some distance around the
place where it was found the needle will not traverse, and a great
proportion of the tallest trees have been struck with lightning.
Whether these phenomena are connected with the existence of a large
mass of native iron, I leave for others to determine: the facts,
however, may be relied on.</div>

<p>The specimen has been examined chemically, by Mr. Shepherd, at
Yale College. It is invested with highly crystalline plumbago, and
splits by the intervention of plates of plumbago into pyramidal and
tetrahedral masses. It is not equal to meteoric iron in malleability,
toughness, and flexibility, and has not the silvery white appearance
of that iron. Its specific gravity is from 5.95 to 6.72. It has
native steel intermingled in it, but contains no nickel, or any other
alloy.</p>

<p>Major Barrall has only been to the place where this iron occurred
<em class="italic">once</em>, and no other person has ever been to the place, or knows
where it is.—<em class="italic">Silliman’s Journal</em>, xii. 154.

<p>M. Boussingault has remarked a singlar deficiency in the
<span class="xxpn" id="p226">[p226]</span>
specific gravity of the native alloys of gold and silver when
compared with calculation, or with the results obtained from an alloy
similar in composition prepared by fusion; thus the native gold of
Marmato has a specific gravity of 12.666, whereas, by calculation, it
ought to be 16.931. The gold of Malpaso, by experiment, is 14.706, by
calculation, 18.223, and by fusion, 18.1. The gold of Santa Rosa, by
experiment, is 14.149, and by calculation, 16.175. This difference,
M. Boussingault says, is not due to porosity in the native gold, as
he has observed it in the granular and fine varieties, but a peculiar
character of the metal in this state. Such an enormous difference,
however, is one that can be admitted only upon repeated experimental
proofs, made in the most unexceptionable manner; and, considering
that it is only in some of the metals that any permanent difference
in specific gravity can be established, and even with them to but a
small extent, would be a fact so important as to be worth extreme
trouble in the verification.—<em class="italic">Annales de Chimie</em>, xxxiv. 408.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>8. <em class="italic">Prothéeïte—a new
Mineral</em>.</h5>—This mineral was discovered in
1826, at Rothenkoph, in the valley of Zillerthal, Tyrol. It occurs
in rectangular prisms, generally without distinct summits, and rough
at both ends. The angles are very seldom truncated, the faces are
striated longitudinally. The crystals are of various sizes, some
being very small, but they have occurred 5 inches in length, and two
in width; the longitudinal fracture is lamellar, the cross-fracture
conchoidal. The substance is usually fissured, nearly opaque in large
specimens, translucent or diaphanous in small masses. Its colour is
crysolite green or white, or between the two; its lustre between that
of glass and the diamond; it is heavy; a good conductor of heat;
hard enough to scratch glass; infusible before the blowpipe; highly
electric by friction. The white crystals have a fibrous texture,
which, as well as the colour, seems the result of decomposition. When
cut and polished, the mineral assumes a great variety of aspects;
the green parts then resemble the finest crysolites, but the fibrous
white parts, when cut of a round form, present one or two reflections
on a transparent ground which move as the stone is moved, just like
those from the cat’s eye; these reflections are very brilliant, and
are accompanied by numerous iris colours, which move like those on
the opal. This phenomenon is often observed in the rough stone,
which, when exposed to light, exhibit certain deep red tints of a
cupreous colour, and metallic lustre on all the faces.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em>
B. xi. 42.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>9. <em class="italic">Volcanic Bisulphuret of Copper</em>.</h5>—M. N. Covelli, during his
examinations of Mount Vesuvius, has observed some particular actions
going on, especially in the fumeroles on the eastern side of the
mountain, and within the crater. Speaking of the former, he says,
“Here there are fumeroles in which pure chloride of lead
<span class="xxpn" id="p227">[p227]</span>
sublimes into white and yellow crystallizations, which fusing in the
hotter places form nacres, gum, and stalactites. In many parts the
sulphuretted hydrogen, evolved within the fumeroles, reacts on the
chloride, and forms sulphuret of lead, dispersed in small scales
through the scoria. Other fumeroles produce very thin scales of the
black oxide of copper; these are very brilliant, metalloidal, and
flexible, and are produced by the action of the vapour of water
at a red heat on the chloride of copper, which may be observed on
disturbing the fumeroles. Here and there the reaction of aqueous
vapour on the perchloride of iron produces metalloidal scales of
the peroxide of iron; whilst further on, the same vapour, acting
on mixtures of the two chlorides, produces oligiste iron in small
crystals, aggregated on the scoria. The muriatic acid resulting
from these actions, and the sulphuric acid which is formed by the
decomposition of hydrosulphurets and sulphates, attack the iron,
lime, copper, alumine, potash, &#38;c., in the lavas and scoria, and
hence result a number of other productions which line the passages of
the fumeroles”.</div>

<p>M. Covelli descended into the crater, until within 300 feet of the
edge of the large eastern opening, from which the great current of
lava flowed in 1822. Here the fumeroles presented the most beautiful
crystallizations of sulphate of lime and sulphur. On examining the
scoria they were found incrusted and covered with a substance,
having all the shades of colour belonging to blue, green, and black.
Sometimes it resembled a spider’s web in appearance, sometimes
soot deposited in the cavities of the scoria. Many specimens were
collected, and also a portion of water condensed from the vapours
which issued forth, and which evidently contained sulphuretted
hydrogen and muriatic acid. The temperature of the vapour was as high
as 85° C., in some places, and even up to 90°, at half a foot beneath
the surface.</p>

<p>The water being examined was found to contain only a little
sulphuretted hydrogen, and a little muriatic acid. The black
substance was soon ascertained to be a pure sulphuret of copper.
Being analyzed, 100 parts yielded 32 parts of sulphur, and 66 of
copper, a loss of two parts being incurred, which accords very nearly
with the composition of the bi-sulphuret of copper. The blue and
bluish-green substances were found to be mixtures of this sulphuret
with sulphate and hydro-sulphuret of copper.</p>

<p>M. Covelli concludes that this substance has been formed by the
action of sulphuretted hydrogen on the sulphate and muriate of copper
evolved by these fumeroles; and observes, that its composition
accords with such an opinion, the deutoxide being that which forms
the Vesuvian cupreous salts.—<em class="italic">Ann. de Chimie</em>, xxxv. 105.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>10. <em class="italic">Fall of
the Lake Souwando in Russia</em>.</h5>—This lake, situated in
the parish of Sakkola, in the Russian government of Wibourg, and
surrounded by the lands of the Barons Friedrichs, was near
<span class="xxpn" id="p228">[p228]</span>
40 versts in length, and had the form of a Γ, or Greek G.
Before the year 1818, it was separated from the lake of Ladoga by
an interval about a verst in width, called Taipale, on which was a
sandy hill; its waters flowed into the river Wuoxa, which united the
lakes of Saima and Ladoga. On the 14th May, 1818, the waters of the
lake Souwando, increased by the thaw and the tempests, overcame the
natural dyke at the foot of the lake, threw down the hill of sand,
rapidly flowed into the lower lake, carrying away all the surrounding
grounds, and for ever destroyed the barrier which had previously
separated them. A chapel and a countryman’s house were carried away
with the pastures and meadows; the waters of the lower lake were much
disturbed, and the surface covered with ruins. The level of the lake
Souwando fell
<span class="mixfract">12<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
archines, and its length is now only 15 versts.
Its waters no longer flow off by the Wuoxa, but pass into the lower
lake by several falls through a deep canal. The land which has been
uncovered by the water is already cultivated, and the beauty of the
surrounding country said to be increased.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em>, F. x. 133.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>11. <em class="italic">Vegetable Torpor
observed in the Roots of the Black
Mulberry-tree</em>.</h5>—A very old mulberry-tree was broken into four
quarters by the wind in 1790. Two of the quarters were destroyed,
the other two remained growing for a few years, but the last of
them was removed in 1802. An elder-tree grew in the place of the
mulberry-tree, without doubt from berries which had fallen into
the middle of the old trunk of the latter. This elder-tree died in
1826, and at the time of its languishing about a dozen of mulberry
shoots started forth to the day. M. Dureau de la Malle ascertained
that these did not spring from seeds, but from the roots of the old

inactive state, for 24 years, to send forth shoots at last.—<em class="italic">Ann. de

<div class="h5d"><h5>12. <em class="italic">Method of increasing the
Odour of Roses</em>.</h5>—For this purpose, according to the author of
the method, a large onion is to be planted by the side of the rose
tree in such a manner that it shall touch the foot of the latter.
The roses which will be produced will have an odour much stronger
and more agreeable than such as have not been thus treated, and
the water distilled from these roses is equally superior to that
prepared by means of ordinary rose leaves.—<em class="italic">Œkonom.

<div class="h5d"><h5>13. <em class="italic">Pine Apples</em>.</h5>—A great
improvement may be made in keeping pine apples by twisting off their
crowns, which are generally suffered to remain and to live upon the
fruit till they have sucked out all the goodness. It will be very
easy for fruiterers to keep a few crowns by them in water, which can
be pegged or stuck on with dough, for show, when the fruit is served
up, or artificial ones <span class="xxpn" id="p229">[p229]</span> may
be made. A pine apple will keep for a long time when its crown is
removed, and will also be greatly improved in flavour, for the more
aqueous parts of the fruit gradually evaporate, and leave it much
more saccharine and vinous in its flavour; which natural process is
totally destroyed by the vegetation of the crown, just upon the same
principle that an onion or carrot loses its flavour when it begins to
sprout in the spring.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>14. <em class="italic">Mode of Condensing
and Preserving Vegetable Substances for Ships’ Provision,
&#38;c.</em></h5>—The quantity of liquid matter which enters into the
constitution of vegetables is very great; when they are deprived
of it their bulk is very trifling. That preparation of animal
food called <em class="italic">pemmican</em>, in which six pounds
of meat are condensed into the space of one, is mainly effected
by abstracting all the fluid from it. Vegetables may be treated
in the same way: let them undergo the process of boiling over
a fierce wood fire, so as to preserve their colour when <em
class="italic">completely</em> cooked; grind them into a complete
pulp by some such means as are used to crush apples for cider,
&#38;c.; then let them be subjected to the action of the press,
(being first put into hair bags, or treated as grapes are in wine
countries,) till all the fluid matter is separated from them; the
remainder of their substance becomes wonderfully condensed, and as
hard as the <em class="italic">marc</em> from the wine press. Then
let it be rammed hard into carefully glazed air-tight jars, (or tin
cases, if preferred,) and subjected to the Appertian process for
preserving animal and vegetable matters, (well known, by-the-by, to
our grandmothers, who preserved gooseberries in this way from time
immemorial.) If jars are used, they may be sufficiently secured by
having two pieces of bladder tied successively over them; when the
air within is absorbed by heating the inclosed substance, their
surface becomes concave by the pressure of the atmosphere, and as
long as it remains in this state the matter within is safe. If it
should be thought requisite to preserve the flavour of the vegetables
entire, an extract should be made from the expressed liquid, and
added to the <em class="italic">marc</em>. But spinage, cabbage, and
many others, have abundance of flavour in them in their dry state
without this addition. The preparation of the vegetable matter for
use is accomplished by adding a sufficient quantity of milk, water,
gravy, lime juice, &#38;c., to the <em class="italic">marc</em>,
and warming it up. Let the government, and the dealers in ships’
provision, look to this; a sufficient quantity of this <em
class="italic">vegetable pemmican</em> would be the greatest luxury
to a ship’s crew, and render the scurvy utterly obsolete. It is
worthy of remark, that the most irritable stomach is not offended by
vegetables treated in this way.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>15. <em class="italic">Rewards for the
Discovery of Quinia, and for Lithotrity</em>.</h5>—The
Académie des Sciences has adjudged a prize of 10,000 francs to <span class="allcaps">MM</span>.
Pelletier and Caventou, for their discovery and introduction
<span class="xxpn" id="p230">[p230]</span>
into use of sulphate of quinia; and another prize of 10,000 francs to
M. Civiale, for having been the first to practise lithotrity on the
living body, and for having successfully operated by his method on a
great number of persons afflicted with the stone in the bladder.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>16. <em class="italic">Upon the Gaseous
Exhalations of the Skin</em>.</h5>—M. Collard de Martigny, having
experimented on this subject, has obtained results which tend to
reconcile the differences existing between previous observers. The
Count de Milly first announced, in the year 1777, that an aëriform
fluid escapes in great quantity from the surface of the skin, and
he considered the gas as carbonic acid. Cruikshank, Jurene, and
Abernethy participated in this opinion. Ingenhouz, on the other
hand, maintained that the air so secreted was azote. M. Frousset
adopted the opinion of Ingenhouz, and endeavoured to confirm it by
experiments. Lastly, Priestley and Fontana questioned the reality of
a gaseous exhalation from the skin; and Fourcroy positively denied
it.</div>

<p>From the experiments of M. Collard de Martigny, he deduces,</p>

<p>i. That a gaseous exhalation really takes place from the skin.</p>

<p>ii. This exhalation is not morbid: it is observable in health.</p>

<p>iii. It is composed of carbonic acid and azote, in very variable
proportions. The following experiment was frequently made. The
bubbles of air which are disengaged from the skin were received into
a funnel, the top of which was closed: they were then passed into a
graduated tube, and agitated with a solution of potash. The height
to which the solution rose in the tube indicated the quantities of
carbonic acid that had been absorbed. All these operations were made
at the same temperature and pressure. Neither hydrogen nor oxygen gas
were discovered in this air.</p>

<p>iv. It does occur continually; but very often we may vainly attempt
to discover it, which has been the cause of error in the results of
Priestley, Fontana and Fourcroy. It is especially suspended after
exercise long continued in the middle of the day, or immediately
after taking an abundant meal. Sometimes it is suspended without any
apparent cause.</p>

<p>v. The quantity also is very variable; but it was observed to be
constantly in an inverse ratio to the cutaneous absorption.</p>

<p>vi. The proportions of the two gases vary very much, and sometimes
the exhaled gas consists almost entirely of azote: in other instances
the predominance of carbonic acid is so great that it appears to be
the only product.—<em class="italic">Med. Rep.</em>, N. S. v. 75.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>17. <em class="italic">Effects of Galvanism
in Cases of Asphyxia by submersion</em>.</h5>—M. Leroy d’Etioles has
addressed a letter to the Académie de Médecine, in reply to an
assertion made by M. Thillaye respecting the inutility of galvanism
in cases of asphyxia. The former says, that when a short and fine
needle is inserted in the sides of the body between the eighth
and ninth ribs so as to come in contact with <span class="xxpn"
id="p231">[p231]</span> the attachment of the diaphragm, and then
the current of electricity from 25 or 30 pair of inch plates passed
through them, that the diaphragm immediately contracts, and an
inspiration is effected. Upon breaking the communication, and again
completing it, a second inspiration is occasioned, and by continuing
these means, a regular respiration may ultimately be occasioned. This
power thus applied has always succeeded with him in experiments on
drowned animals.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em>, C. xi. 213.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>18. <em class="italic">Recovery from
Drowning</em>.</h5>—M. Bourgeois had occasion accidentally to give
assistance in a case where, after a person had been twenty minutes
under water, he was taken out, and by a very common but serious
mistake, carried with his head downwards. The usual means were
tried unremittingly, but unsuccessfully, for a whole hour, but at
the end of that time a little blood flowed from a vein that had
been opened, and a ligature being placed on the arm, ten ounces of
blood were withdrawn: the circulation and respiration were then
gradually re-established, horrible convulsions, and a frightful state
of tetanus coming on at the same time; copious bleeding was again
effected, after which a propensity to sleep came on: a third bleeding
the following morning was followed by the recovery of the patient.
Hence M. Bourgeois concludes that the means of recovering a drowned
person should never be abandoned until the decomposition of the body
has commenced.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em>, C. xi. 213.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>19. <em class="italic">Preservation of
Cantharides</em>.</h5>—It is stated by M. Farines that the active part
of cantharides exists only in the soft organs of the insect; that
these are the parts which are attacked by a species of acarus, and
that in this way the cantharides are injured. Camphor has no power of
preventing the attacks of the acarus; but M. Farines believes that
pyroligneous acid will be found effectual, and proposes to prepare
cantharides with it, and even to kill them at the time when they are
collected by submersion in it.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>20. <em class="italic">Chloride of Lime in cases
of Burns</em>.</h5>—The good effect of chloride of lime in cases of burns
is confirmed by the experience of M. Lisfranc. He has applied it in
many cases of that kind, sometimes immediately after the accident,
sometimes after the application of emollient cataplasms. Lint is
moistened in a solution more or less strong of chloride of lime, and
then applied to the place, being covered over with waxed cloth. The
cure has been singularly hastened under its influence and in one
case where almost the whole of the lower limbs, the arms and face,
had been burnt, the use of the chloride recovered the patient from
the stupor into which he had fallen at the end of four days, and a
perfect recovery was effected two months after the accident.—<em
class="italic">Bull. Univ</em>., C. xi. 77. <span class="xxpn"
id="p232">[p232]</span></div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>21. <em class="italic">Cure of Nasal
Polypi</em>.</h5>—Dr. Primus of Babenhausen asserts, that the saffronised
tincture of opium (of the Prussian Pharmacopœia) possesses the
property of gradually destroying nasal polypi when applied to them.
Certain cures, which have been thus effected, have already been
published, and a striking one occurred in January, 1826. A man, 46
years of age, had one in each nostril. The tincture was applied
several times a day to the bases of the polypi, by means of a small
hair-brush or lint roll. In eight days the tumours had assumed a
paler appearance, and lost a little in volume; a serous secretion
from the nose, which had existed for a long time, was diminished, and
the pituitary membrane had acquired a more lively tint, as if in a
sub-inflammatory state. The application was continued, the tumours
continued to decrease, and at the end of three weeks had entirely
disappeared.—<em class="italic">Mediz. Chirurg. Zeitung</em>, 1826,
p. 13.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>22. <em class="italic">Bite of the
Viper</em>.</h5>—M. Jacopo Sacchi, of Barzio in Valsasina, having had
occasion to take charge of some cases in which injury had been
inflicted by the bite of a viper (Coluber Berus), transferred his
observations upon them into the hands of Professor Paletta. From
these it appears that ammonia, recommended by Dr. Mangili, in 1813,
although an excellent remedy in many cases, is by no means sufficient
in all, but must occasionally be seconded by every possible means.
Although sometimes nature alone has power sufficient to overcome
the bite of a viper, yet, at other times, the injury is so great
and sudden as to resemble the effects of hydrocyanic acid. In these
cases he recommends that the patient should be put into a hot bed
covered with woollen clothes, and the most powerful sudorifics with
some tonics administered internally. Friction should be applied all
over the body, and at the same time the wounds are to be enlarged,
cupping-glasses applied, and tow, dipped in ammonia, applied to the
spot.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>23. <em class="italic">Experiments on
the Poison of the Viper</em>.</h5>—M. Desaulx confirms
the fact that dogs can swallow with impunity even large quantities
of the poison of vipers. He observed also that when this poison
was withdrawn from the vesicles it soon lost in power, and
after a certain time became inert: a portion ten days old being
introduced into a fresh wound of a living animal, only caused slight
tumefaction on the part. Mangili, on the contrary, found it, when
hermetically sealed up, to retain its virulence for many months. The
species of viper from which M. Desaulx obtained his poison is not
mentioned.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em> C. xi. 142.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>24. <em class="italic">Destruction of
Moles</em>.</h5>—The following method of destroying moles
is asserted, by the Count de Boisseulh, to be excellent. Grounds much
infested by these animals have been perfectly freed from them by
means of it. A number of worms must be procured, killed, and powdered
with pulverised vomica-nut; the whole is to
<span class="xxpn" id="p233">[p233]</span>
be mixed and left
for twenty-four hours. The mole-tracks are then to be opened, and two
or three of these worms placed in each hole. If the meadow is large,
they cannot be placed in every hole; but by multiplying them as much
as possible, a good result is sure to be obtained.—<em class="italic">Ann. de Agricul.

<div class="h5d"><h5>25. <em class="italic">On growing Salad-herbs
at Sea</em>.</h5>—On long sea-voyages, whatever
esculent roots, or fruit, or whatever vegetable essences may be
stowed in the steward’s stores, whether for the use of the officers
or crew, nothing can be a greater treat to the former, especially
within the tropics, than a dish of fresh salubrious salad-herbs. The
want of such an addition to the ordinary fare on board a ship has
often been a cause of disease, and misfortune, and even death!—it
is needless, therefore, to insist on the usefulness, or to state
the antiscorbutic, and consequently sanatory qualities, of fresh
vegetables in such situations; and however limited the means to
supply such a want as is described below, yet, as it may be highly
useful to convalescents, and in individual cases, the publication may
not be deemed altogether valueless.</div>

<p>Provide one, two, or three deal boards, made of well-seasoned inch
stuff, sixteen inches square, with a ledge all round, rising one
inch above the smooth surface of the board; and as it is intended to
hold water, the ledges must be closely and neatly fitted: at each
corner a nail, or small hook, should be placed, with strings tied
into a loop above, by which the board may be slung in the necessary
horizontal position; a thin covering-board, made of the same material
and dimensions, is also necessary, and which will serve for all the
boards.</p>

<p>Pieces of the <em class="italic">thickest</em> flannel must be had for each board, cut so
as to fit exactly within the ledges. These flannels require to be
well soaked, and repeatedly washed in boiling water, before they can
be used, to discharge from them whatever is pernicious to vegetation
as they come from the manufacturer’s hands.</p>

<p>The board and flannel thus prepared, dip the flannel in water, and
place on the boards; sow the seeds pretty thick and regularly;
sprinkle them lightly with the hand, till all are moistened and the
flannel completely saturated; in which state it should always be kept
during the growth of the plants. Too much water floats the seeds when
first put on, and are thereby shifted from their places by the motion
of the ship. The cover-board must now be put on, and the whole hung
up in its place. The use of this board is to assist the vegetation of
the seeds, which it will do sufficiently in the course of twenty-four
hours; after which it may be laid aside.</p>

<p>The board must be frequently examined, and when the moisture thereon
is diminished by evaporation, or imbibed by the crop, a supply must
be given, just enough to keep the flannel in the proper saturated
state.</p>

<p>In six or seven days the crop will be (if the weather has been
favourable) two inches high,—it is then fit for use. The produce
<span class="xxpn" id="p234">[p234]</span>
of one board yields about as much as will fill a middle-sized
salad-bowl, and when dressed up with the usual condiments of onion,
salt, vinegar, and oil, a most agreeable salad will be composed, and
a most acceptable treat to the guests at the captain’s table.</p>

<p>It is necessary that the board, as well as the flannel, be scalded,
well washed, and dried in the sun, before it can be used again;—and
as one board yields one crop per week, two, or even three boards may
be used at the same time, in order to secure a regular supply. Larger
boards are not so convenient, because they can only be hung in some
by-corner of a cabin, quarter-gallery, or state-room, where they may
not only be out of the way, but out of the sun and currents of air.</p>

<p class="clearfix">The herbs suitable to be raised in this way are, radish, mustard, and
common garden-cress. The two first answer best within the tropics;
the last does not, being too delicate and diminutive;—but this does
very well when the ship is no nearer the equator than thirty degrees
of latitude. One peck of radish, another of mustard, and two quarts
of cress, will be sufficient for an India and China voyage,—a supply
of which may be had in China.</p>

26. <em class="italic">Chinese Method of fattening
Fish</em>.</h5>—The Chinese are celebrated
for their commercial acumen, indefatigable industry, and natural
adroitness,—in making the most of every gift of nature bestowed
on their fertile country. Useful as well as ornamental vegetables
engross their every care; and animals which are the most profitably
reared, and which yield the greatest quantity of rich and savoury
food, are preferred by them for supplying their larders and stews.
Their <em class="italic">hortus dietetica</em> would form a considerable list; and
though they do not use such a variety of butcher’s meat and fowl
as Europeans do, yet in the articles of pork, geese, and ducks,
they surpass, in the use of fish they equal, us, and in their
domestication and management of them they excel all other nations.</div>

<p>A few observations on their <em class="italic">piscinas</em>, or fish-stews, is the design
of this paper; not merely as an historical description, but as an
object for imitation in this or any other country.</p>

<p>For twenty or thirty miles round Canton, and as far as the eye can
reach on each side of the river on which that city stands, the
general face of the country appears nearly a level plain, with but
little undulation of surface. The level is, however, richly studded
with beautiful hills, which diversify the landscape, and seem to rise
out of the plain so abruptly, that they form the most picturesque
features, united with the most pleasing combinations. The soil of
the plain consists of a pure alluvial earth of great fertility and
depth, and very retentive of water; which, by the by, is a proof
that, notwithstanding their claim to high chronological antiquity,
the waters of the deluge remained much longer (perhaps for ages) on
this portion of the continent of Asia, than it did in the interior:
and the circumstance of many of their hills being cultivated to
the
<span class="xxpn" id="p235">[p235]</span>
very top, their numerous water-plants, and their almost
amphibious habits as to their domiciles, are still further proofs
that the country was, once, more of an aquaium than it now is.
Hence the facility of making canals, which are their high-roads (as
wheel-carriages, and beasts of draught, are too expensive appendages,
for the systematic economy of the celestial empire!) and hence the
ease with which a pond may be made in any otherwise useless corner.
Such tanks, or ponds, are generally met with in market-garden
grounds, where they serve the double purpose of a reservoir, and a
stew for rearing and fattening fish.</p>

<p>When a pond is made for this purpose, and filled with water, the
owner goes to market, and buys as many young store-fish as his pond
can conveniently hold; this he can easily do, as almost all their
fish are brought to market alive. Placed in the stew, they are
regularly fed morning and evening, or as often as the feeder finds it
necessary; their food is chiefly boiled rice, to which is added, the
blood of any animals they may kill, wash from their stewing-pots and
dishes, &#38;c., indeed any animal offal or vegetable matter which the
fish will eat. It is said, they also use some oleaceous medicament
in the food, to make the fish more voracious, in order to accelerate
their fattening; but of this the writer could obtain no authentic
account.</p>

<p>Fish so fed and treated, advance in size rapidly, though not to any
great weight; as the kind (a species of perch) which came under
observation, never arrive at much more than a pound avoirdupois; but
from the length of three or four inches, when first put in, they grow
to eight or nine in a few months, and are then marketable. Drafts
from the pond are then occasionally made; the largest are first taken
off, and conveyed in large shallow tubs of water to market: if sold,
well; if not, they are brought back and replaced in the stew, until
they can be disposed of.</p>

<p>This business of fish-feeding is so managed that the stock are
all fattened off about the time the water is most wanted for the
garden-crops. The pond is then cleaned out, the mud carefully saved,
or spread as manure,—again filled with water, stocked with young
fry, and fed as before.</p>

<p>An intelligent Chinaman, from whom the writer had the above detail,
and who showed him as much of the process as could be seen during a
residence of three months, declared as his belief, that a spot of
ground, containing from twenty to thirty square yards, would yield a
greater annual profit as a stew, than it would in any other way to
which it could possibly be applied.</p>

<p class="clearfix">That fish may be tamed, suffer themselves to be caressed, and even
raised out of their natural element by the hand, has been long known
to naturalists; witness the famous old carp formerly in the pond
of some religious house at Chantilly, in France, with many other
instances on record. But it is probable no people has carried the art
of stew-feeding fish, and practising it as a profitable concern, to
such lengths, as is done by the Chinese at this day.

<h3><em class="italic">On the Means generally used with the Intention
of curing a Stoop</em>.<a id="fnanchor_37_1" href="#fn_37_1"
class="fnanchor">37</a> <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">W<span>HEN</span></span> the chest and the head fall forward, the most common
method of trying to correct the stoop is to put on some instrument
by which the shoulders and the head are held back. To
operate upon the shoulders, the common back-collar is applied,
and to hold back the head, a riband is brought over the forehead
and fastened to the collar.</p>

<p>While these instruments are kept on, the figure looks
straight, though stiff and constrained; but the moment they
are taken off, both the head and the shoulders fall more forward,
than before their application. Many examples of the
bad effect of artificially supporting the head might be offered.
The following, although observed in the figure of a horse, is
very demonstrative. When the rein (called the bearing-rein),
by which the head of a carriage-horse is reared up, with the
intention of giving him a showy figure, is loosened, the head
immediately falls forward, and the neck, instead of preserving
the fine arch that is so much admired, droops between the
shoulders. Looking to this effect, we should at first be
inclined to condemn the practice followed by horse-dealers, of
reining up the head of a young horse in the stable, by means
of the apparatus called a dumb-jockey. But on examining
into this mode of fixing the head, it will be found to operate
on a different principle from the bearing-rein. Instead of a
<span class="xxpn" id="p238">[p238]</span>
simple bit, such as the horse in harness can lean his head
upon, without suffering pain, a bit, calculated to tease and
fret, is put into the young horse’s mouth. To relieve himself
from the irritation produced by this, and which is increased by
the constant pull of the elastic piece of iron to which the rein
is fastened, he curls up his neck, and thus brings all the
muscles of the back of the neck into strong action, instead
of allowing their power to be superseded by the artificial support
afforded by the bearing-rein to the horse in harness<a id="fnanchor_38_2" href="#fn_38_2" class="fnanchor">38</a>.</p>

<p>Many different contrivances, but all acting nearly on the
same principle as the <em class="italic">bearing-rein</em>, have been proposed as
means for obliging a girl to keep her head erect.</p>

<div class="figc-s4">
<img src="images/i238.jpg" width="348" height="442" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There is one mode which, to a person ignorant of anatomy,
seems to be particularly well adapted for this purpose; but it
is, in fact, more objectionable than the plan of tying the head
back with a riband. A piece of lead, of some pounds weight,
<span class="xxpn" id="p239">[p239]</span>
is slung over the back in such a way that it must be supported
by a riband put around the head.</p>

<p>Although this contrivance prevents the head for a time from
falling forwards, its bad effects may be demonstrated. When
the weight is on, the muscles of the back of the spine are passive,
while those on the fore-part of the neck are necessarily
brought into action to prevent the head from being pulled too
far back: this is easily proved; for if we put the fingers on
the sternal portions of the sterno-cleido muscle, which, with
the small muscles on the fore-part of the throat, pull the head
forwards, we shall feel them tense and in action. The increased
activity of the muscles on the fore part, and the passive condition
of those of the back, may be further exemplified by raising
the weight when the girl is not aware of our doing so; the
head will then be immediately poked forwards.</p>

<p>We have many opportunities of observing the incorrectness
of the principle on which all similar plans for the cure of a
stoop have been founded. For instance, porters who carry
burthens on the back, by the assistance of a band round the
forehead, always stoop; while those who carry baskets before
them suspended by a band round the back of the neck, are
peculiarly erect. But the most remarkable example of the
effect of the head being pulled back by a weight hung behind,
is the condition of the women who carry salt in the streets of
Edinburgh, for they may be recognised as much by their miserable
Sardonic grin, which is caused by the constant excitement
of the platysma myoides muscle, as by their stoop.</p>

<p>Very annoying and even distressing consequences may ensue
from any system of treatment where a constant resistance to
the muscles of the fore-part of the neck is kept up. A gentleman
had for many years worn one of the collars invented by
Mr. Chesher; after some time, the muscles of the back became
so weak, as to be incapable of supporting the column, while
those on the fore-part of the neck were so disproportionately
increased in strength, by the constant resistance opposed
to them by the strap passing from the suspending rod under
the chin, that whenever the strap was loosened, the chin was
forcibly drawn towards the chest. As the muscles of the back
part of the neck did not offer any counteracting resistance, the
<span class="xxpn" id="p240">[p240]</span>
windpipe was now pressed down, or almost doubled itself.
As soon as this took place (and it was almost immediate on
the attempt to sit up without the collar,) the patient was seized
with such a sense of suffocation, as to be obliged to throw
himself on his back. As he was able to breathe with ease as
he lay on his back, his advisers were led to believe that it was
the weight of the head which pressed down the windpipe. To
counteract this pressure, various contrivances had been proposed
to support the head. Indeed, the patient himself
was so convinced, from what he had heard, that it was the
weight of the head which pressed down the windpipe, and so
alarmed had he become from the certainty of having a fit of
suffocation when the head was left unsupported, that there was
much difficulty in persuading him to believe that if the head
could be made <em class="italic">heavier</em>, the sense of suffocation would be relieved.
He was at length induced, although with great dread
of the consequence, to allow about fourteen pounds of shot to
be placed on the top of his head. He was very much alarmed,
but it was highly gratifying to witness his surprise and pleasure
in finding that, instead of his head being weighed down,
he could support it, and could breathe with ease while in the
upright posture. The following is the principle on which this
plan was proposed:—the muscles of the back part of the
neck had been brought into such a state, that their ordinary
stimulus was not sufficient to excite them to the action necessary
to counteract the efforts of those on the fore-part of the
neck, which had been evidently increased in strength. The
placing a weight on a certain spot on the head formed an additional
stimulus to the muscles of the back part of the neck; a
fact which the reader may prove by an experiment on himself.</p>

<p>By proceeding on this principle, by combining a variety of
exercises, and by gradually diminishing the weight carried on
the head, this gentleman was soon able to walk and sit in a
state of great comfort, without being obliged to use any artificial
support.</p>

<p>It is well known, that the neck-collars support almost the whole
weight of the head and shoulders by the strap which
passes under the chin. It must also have been observed, that
the wearer very frequently pushes down the head against the
<span class="xxpn" id="p241">[p241]</span>
chin strap. In this way, the muscles on the fore-part necessarily
become stronger, while those of the back, being deprived
of their natural stimulus to action, in consequence of the rod
superseding their office, become diminished in power. Even
were there no change in the degree of strength in the muscles
on the fore-part, the head would naturally fall, if the support
afforded by the chin strap were removed; but as these muscles
are increased in power, while those of the back are diminished,
the head must not only fall, but even be pulled down.</p>

<p>However, although the collars and the lead weight, as they
are generally used, are not only inefficacious; but even hurtful,
they may occasionally be useful in keeping the head in a certain
position, after it has been brought to it by such exercises
as tend to strengthen those muscles of the back which
support the shoulders and head. But the opinions commonly
entertained, as to the means of counteracting an habitual
stoop, are so erroneous, that even the position of a tailor sitting
on his shopboard is better than the plans generally recommended.
This at first appears ridiculous; but the manner
a tailor holds his body when he walks, proves that there is
something in his habits which tends to the correction of a
stoop; for he is quite a caricature of a strutting erect figure,
especially in the way he bends in his loins and carries his head.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of the tailor’s gait proceeds, in a certain degree,
from the bent position in which he sits: but this explanation
is not at first satisfactory, since it may be observed that other
tradesmen, who also stoop while at work, generally have their
head inclined forwards, and have also a distinct and habitual
bend in the neck; such, especially, is the condition of persons
who sit at a table and stoop forwards, as watchmakers, engravers,
&#38;c. It is not difficult to explain the cause of the difference,
and the inquiry will assist in directing us to the principles
which we ought to recollect in our operations upon the
spine.</p>

<p>In the sitting position of the tailor, the head hangs so low,
and so complete an arch is formed between it and the pelvis,
that the muscles of the spine are called into strong action to
support the head; the necessary consequence of this is, that
these muscles become even unnaturally strong, or at least so
strong as to predominate over those by which the spine is
<span class="xxpn" id="p242">[p242]</span>
pulled forward. But the bent position is not the only cause
of increase in the strength of the muscles, for it depends also
on the exercise given by frequently jerking the head backwards.
In those who stoop from the middle of the body, as in
writing or working at a table, the muscles of the spine are not
called into action; for, while the head is in this position, it
rests or is supported by the ligament of the neck. The ligament,
being thus kept constantly on the stretch, becomes
lengthened, instead of being made more contractile, as muscles
would be; and hence the stoop is increased. When this is
combined with the consequences of the want of muscular
action, the deeper ligaments, which bind the upper vertebræ,
gradually yield; if the operation of these causes continues for
a certain time, the bones and cartilages themselves become
altered in shape, and consequently an almost irremediable
stoop is produced<a id="fnanchor_39_3" href="#fn_39_3" class="fnanchor">39</a>.</p>

<p>This view derives confirmation, from what may be observed
in the shape of the tailors in some parts of Germany,
who, instead of having the erect figures of London tailors, are
quite bent. On inquiring into the cause, we find that, instead
of sitting as tailors do in this country, a hole is cut in the
table, and a seat is placed within it; so that their position,
while working, becomes nearly the same as that of persons who
stoop while sitting at a table.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be objected, that labourers, and especially
the vine-dressers in France, are remarkable for the complete
arch which their body forms, although they bend while at
work as much as the tailor does. This may also be explained;
for in the labourer the bend is produced by the pelvis rolling on
the head of the thigh bones, while in a person sitting as a
tailor the pelvis continues nearly fixed, and the bend is in the
vertebræ on the pelvis.</p>

<p>The erect figure of the Turk perhaps comes from the manner
of sitting which is common among Eastern nations; but the
heavy turban, and the spice box slung from the back of the
neck, may account in a great measure for the fine figures of
the Turkish Jews who frequent the streets of London.
<span class="xxpn" id="p243">[p243]</span></p>

<p>We may even take the shoemaker as an example of the
effect of a particular manner of sitting, and of frequently using
the muscles of the shoulders. He is also a little in caricature,
but he carries himself better than the tailor, and the cause is
obvious. The tailor’s figure is very erect, but the right shoulder
is generally a little higher or larger than the left, from the
constant exercise given to the right arm, while the left rests
upon the knee: this inequality of the shoulders is not observed
in the shoemaker, because he not only uses both arms equally,
but the muscles by which the scapulæ are supported, become
so strong by the habit of jerking back his elbows while he
works, that his shoulders always appear more braced back than
those of any other class of persons: indeed, so characteristic
are the figures of tailors and shoemakers, that they may be
easily distinguished in a crowd.</p>

<p>These circumstances are mentioned, as they afford familiar
examples of the principles on which we ought to proceed, in
endeavouring to correct deformities; but it would be ridiculous
to propose the position either of the tailor or of the shoemaker,
as the best adapted to correct a stoop or falling forward of the
shoulders.</p>

<p>The preceding observations apply also to the contrivances
usually employed to keep the shoulders back, and particularly
to the question of the propriety of using the common back-collar.
The effect which this instrument produces in ordinary
cases may be easily comprehended by the following diagram.</p>

<div class="figc-s5">
<img src="images/i243.jpg" width="252" height="395" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="xxpn" id="p244">[p244]</div>

<p>The part of the back formed by the ribs is not a flat, but
rather a round surface; and as the shoulder-blades rest on
this, they would fall forwards were they not prevented by the
collar-bones; but as these bones are united to the breast-bone
by a moveable joint, and as the weight of the arms operates
principally on the anterior angles of the scapulæ, both the
collar-bones and the shoulders would fall forwards, were it not
for the action of several strong muscles which pass from the
spine to the scapulæ. But these muscles may be destroyed by
any contrivance which supersedes their use. For example, let
A A be the shoulder-blades, and B B the muscles which support
them. If the scapulæ be brought close to the spine by the
straps of the collar, and kept constantly so, there can be no
use for the muscles B B. They must consequently waste and
become nearly useless, while those on the fore-part of the
chest, being excited to resist the straps, will become increased
in power; and hence, when the collar is taken off, not only
will the shoulders fall forward as in a delicate person, but the
muscles on the fore-part of the chest will predominate over
those by which the scapulæ should be held back, and <em class="italic">pull</em> the
shoulders forwards.</p>

<p>The spine and the ribs are occasionally bent so as to have
some resemblance to the back of a spoon. In such cases, the
shoulders not only appear high and round, but the lower angles
of the scapulæ project in an extraordinary manner, because the
upper and anterior angle is not only unsupported by the ribs,
but is dragged forwards by the clavicles which are carried in
the same direction with the sternum. When this is to a considerable
extent, it constitutes the <em class="italic">contracted chest</em> or the <em class="italic">chicken
breast</em>. This, in a slight degree, is common in London, and
especially among young lads; it may be discovered by the
coat having the appearance of being more worn opposite the
lower angle of the scapula than at any other part. Such a
condition of the chest can only be completely remedied by
appropriate exercises; but a collar is here necessary for a time,
to keep the bones in the improved condition into which they
are brought by the exercises.</p>

<p>These arguments will probably appear sufficiently well
founded to prove that a girl, under ordinary circumstances,
<span class="xxpn" id="p245">[p245]</span>
cannot hold her head or shoulders back, unless the muscles by
which they are naturally supported are in a proper condition.
Various contrivances have been proposed to strengthen these
muscles. Dumb bells, if managed in a particular manner, are
good; skipping, when the arms are thrown backwards and
over the head, is still better; the exercises, called Spanish
exercises, performed with two long poles, are also useful, but
to each of these there may be objections, as they all operate
more or less on the spine or ribs, which, in case of a bad
stoop, are generally affected.</p>

<p>The following anecdote will, perhaps, set the question of the
propriety of wearing the back collar in a correct point of view.
A surgeon was consulted by a gentleman, who is now one of
our first tragedians, as to the best mode of correcting a stoop
which he had acquired. The surgeon told him that neither
stays nor straps would do him any essential good; and that the
only method of succeeding was to recollect to keep his shoulders
braced back by a voluntary effort. But the tragedian
replied, that this he could not do, as his mind was otherwise
occupied. The surgeon then told him that he could give him
no further assistance. Shortly after this conversation, the
actor ordered his tailor to make a coat of the finest kerseymere,
so as to fit him very tightly, when his shoulders were thrown
back. Whenever his shoulders fell forward he was reminded
by a pinch under the arms, that his coat cost him six guineas,
and that it was made of very fragile materials; being thus
forced, for the sake of his fine coat, to keep his shoulders back,
he soon cured himself of the stoop. The surgeon was much
obliged to him for the hint, and afterwards, when consulted
whether young ladies should wear shoulder straps, permitted
them, on condition that they were made of fine muslin, or
valuable silk, for tearing which there should be a forfeit.</p>

<p>An inquiry into the manner a girl should sit may appear
trifling to those who have not been in the habit of seeing many
cases of distortion of the spine, but it is intimately connected
with the present subject, and is really of considerable importance.
The question has been disputed; one party insisting
that girls should always sit erect, while others are advocates for
a lounging position. It is not difficult to show that both are
<span class="xxpn" id="p246">[p246]</span>
wrong;—when a delicately formed girl is supposed to be sitting
erect, she is generally sitting crooked: to a superficial observer
she may appear quite straight; but any one who will sit on a
music stool, and endeavour to keep his body in a perpendicular
line for ten minutes, will be convinced that it is difficult for
even a strong man to sit as long as a delicate girl is expected
to do, without allowing the spine to sink to one side or to fall
forwards.</p>

<p>The attempt to sit erect beyond a certain time is injurious,
for although bending the spine occasionally is useful rather
than hurtful, yet when it is done involuntarily, and when the
bend is attempted to be concealed by an endeavour to keep the
head straight, there is danger of the spine becoming twisted.
Indeed, a double curve is generally the consequence; there is
first a bend to one side, to give ease to the fatigued muscles;
and then, to conceal this, there is a second curve that is necessarily
accompanied by a slight twist in the vertical line of the
whole column.</p>

<p>The proposal to allow children to sit in a crooked or lounging
position seems to have been founded on the idea that all the
muscles are more relaxed in this way than even when the child
lies at full length on its back. This notion is certainly incorrect,
and such a mode of sitting is injurious; for even were the
muscles more relaxed by it, the bones and ligaments acquire
such a shape as necessarily produces distortion.</p>

<p>It may naturally be asked how a girl should sit, since it
would appear, that whether she is in an erect or stooping posture,
she is equally in danger of becoming crooked. As sitting,
in the manner generally recommended, affords little or no support
to one who is weak, the safest answer would be, that a
delicate girl should not sit for even more than five or ten minutes
without having some support to her back, and when she
is fatigued, that she should lie down or recline on a couch.
But as it would be very annoying to a girl not to be allowed to
sit up except for so short a time, and as a couch is not always
at hand, we must endeavour to show how a delicate girl may
remain in an upright posture, for a reasonable time without
incurring any risk of becoming crooked. This leads to an
inquiry into the merits of the chairs which are at present generally
used by children.
<span class="xxpn" id="p247">[p247]</span></p>

<p>Young ladies are often obliged, while at their music lessons,
to sit upon those chairs, which have high backs, long legs, and
small seats. These chairs are said to have been invented by a
very eminent surgeon, and are intended, either to prevent distortion,
by some supposed operation on the spine, or as the
most effectual means of supporting the body. It is difficult to
imagine how a chair of this description can effect the first
purpose; and to discover how far it is calculated for the second,
the reader should make the experiment on a chair of the same
proportion to his figure, as the chair in question is to that of a
little girl. He will find that if the seat or surface on which he
rests is small in proportion to his body, the chest will, after a
time, either fall forward or to one side, unless he exert himself
to a degree that is very fatiguing. Indeed, if the seat be at the
same time so high, that the feet do not rest fairly on the ground,
but dangle under the chair, a forward position of the head is
almost necessary to preserve the balance of the figure<a id="fnanchor_40_4" href="#fn_40_4" class="fnanchor">40</a>.</p>

<p>The objections to such chairs have been met with the assertion,
that girls feel remarkably comfortable in them. This is
no argument in favour of their use, for it is not uncommon for
a girl who has seven or eight pounds of iron strapped upon her
body and next to her skin, to say the machine annoys her so
little, that she does not care how long she wears it.</p>

<p>But whether this chair is agreeable or not, it is easy to show
that it is not calculated to give much proper support to the
body, and that it is almost impossible for a delicate girl to sit
long in a natural or easy position upon it.</p>

<p>It may be allowed, that the chair which we consider the most
comfortable, that is, the chair which affords the most support
to the body, should, if made in proper proportions, be the best
for a delicate girl. In such a chair, the <em class="italic">seat</em> should be scarcely
higher than the knees (thus permitting the whole of the foot to
rest on the floor), and of such a size, that on sitting back, the
upper part of the calves nearly touch it. This form of <em class="italic">seat</em> is
very different from that of the chair alluded to, the <em class="italic">back</em> of
which is also equally objectionable, for, instead of being in
<span class="xxpn" id="p248">[p248]</span>
some degree shaped to the natural curves of the spine, it is
made nearly straight, and projects so as to push the head forwards.
A delicate girl should always sit so as to rest against
the back of the chair, and, if the lower part of her spine is
weak, a small cushion will afford great relief. As it is quite a
mistake to suppose that the shoulders, if raised in any other
way than by the action of the muscles, or by the curvature of
the spine and ribs, will continue high, there is no real objection
to a girl who is delicate being supported by an arm-chair; for,
by occasionally resting on the elbows, a considerable weight is
taken off from that part of the spine which is the most likely
to yield.</p>

<p>These observations refer only to the manner in which delicate
girls, whose spines are still straight, should sit: when the spine
is actually distorted, it will be necessary to use other means.</p>

When the Russians wish to give a horse high action in

fore feet. The resistance to be overcome necessarily increases the
strength of certain muscles; and hence, when shoes of the common size
are put on, the horse lifts his feet higher than one which has not
been subjected to this discipline. Some opera dancers practise with

<em class="italic">A Critique on the Aplanatic Object-Glasses, for diverging

M.D. <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">T<span>HE</span></span>
curiosity of many will doubtless be excited, as to what our
neighbours, the French, ever foremost in the pursuit of glory,
both in arts and arms, have been doing in the affair of achromatic
object-glasses for microscopes. With the highest satisfaction
I find myself enabled to state, that Messieurs Chevalier,
(ainé et fils,) No. 69, Quai de l’Horloge, Paris, have rivalled
our own artists, in this branch of the manufacture of optical
instruments.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Lister, actuated by a most laudable zeal for the prosecution
and advancement of optical science, as it concerns
microscopes, caused me to order for him one of Messrs. Chevalier’s
instruments, <em class="italic">in Mr. W. Tulley’s name</em>; for, as Mr. L.
wished that Messrs. C.’s pretensions should be fairly and thoroughly
scrutinized, it was but fair that the latter gentlemen
should be stimulated to do their utmost, by a consideration of
the science of their customer. A critical examination of the
object-glasses of this instrument (for making which every facility
was afforded me by Mr. L.), forms the subject of the present paper.
<span class="xxpn" id="p249">[p249]</span></p>

<p>I here, then, enter upon the discussion of the merits and
demerits of the objectives of the said instrument<a id="fnanchor_41_5" href="#fn_41_5" class="fnanchor">41</a>, these
being much more perfected than those of another, of previous
make, which I saw in the possession of Mr. Howship, of Great
George-street, Hanover-square, to whom I received a letter of
recommendation from Mr. Spilsbury, of Ball-Haye. To the
signal politeness of these gentlemen, in furthering my views, I
am greatly indebted.</p>

<p>Four object-glasses accompany Messrs. Chevaliers’ instruments
(at least those marked <em class="italic">perfectionnés</em>,) usually rated at
the following foci: 14 French lines, 10 ditto, 4 and 4: the two
latter combine together at will, and give a focus of two lines.</p>

<p>14.) Focus about 1.42 of an English inch, clear aperture
0.31, original aperture as reduced by a stop, 0.10.</p>

<p>It is perfectly achromatic with its clear aperture, and may
be used without a stop on most transparent objects; requires
to be cut off to 0.23, to give the necessary distinctness for
opaque ones.—(When I speak of the apertures which C.’s lenses
will bear, I must be understood, here and elsewhere, only with
regard to the <em class="italic">middle of the field of view</em>, or rather that part of
it where the distinctness is greatest<a id="fnanchor_42_6" href="#fn_42_6" class="fnanchor">42</a>, for double object-glasses
give the central rays only correct, and confuse the oblique ones
very much, for which reason, conjoined with the small apertures
they admit of, they were abandoned by Mr. Tulley,
for the triple construction, the true and regular form for the
microscope.)—There is an excess of spherical aberration in
convex lenses; neither are the glasses well ground, or centered,
or duly adjusted. The concave of this object-glass is tarnished,
and there are traces of seediness in the cement, which
is, indeed, to be seen more or less in the whole of them.</p>

<p>10.) Focus about 0.91, clear aperture 0.23, original stop
0.09.
<span class="xxpn" id="p250">[p250]</span></p>

<p>This object-glass is under corrected in point of colour, and
wants to be made longer in the focus to be achromatic. The
excess of uncorrected spherical aberration is in the convex lens;
the glasses are not well ground, centered, or adjusted; the same
appearance of tarnish as in 14; bears its clear aperture for the
middle of the field on most transparent objects, but must be
cut off to 0.2 for opaque ones.</p>

<p>Both of these object-glasses are ineffective upon test objects,
from want of sufficient power and aperture.</p>

<p>4.) Focus about 0.43, clear aperture 0.23, original stop
0.09, perfectly achromatic. The uncorrected spherical aberration
is in the concave; centering and grinding very fine, but
in very bad adjustment; shows some transparent test-objects
pretty well with its clear aperture, and, cut off to about 0.16,
performs well on many opaque ones.</p>

<p>2.) Focus about 4.7, clear aperture 0.21, no stop, perfectly
achromatic, surplus of spherical aberration in the concave as
before; centering and grinding very fine; adjustment tolerable;
in other respects very similar to 4. This object-glass being
adjusted, does more singly on test-objects than any other, and
carries an aperture of 0.16 well on opaque bodies, showing the
lines on the diamond-beetle’s scales strong and well cut out.</p>

<p>Combination of 4 and 2—(quadruple.)</p>

<p>I am happy to be able to speak in terms of almost unqualified
approbation of this composition. It, of course, surpasses
the performance of any single triple-glass, <em class="italic">on those test-objects
which require extravagant angles of aperture</em>. The field also
is good all over; or at least would be, if the glasses were in
adjustment, which is the only drawback upon it. The focus
of the combination is only 0.26, yet it performs admirably on
transparent test-objects with its naked aperture of 0.23, and is
very fine on opaque ones with 0.16, and doubtless would carry
0.2, if the adjustment was duly carried into effect.</p>

<p>Messrs. C. have, I think, most assuredly here hit upon one
of the very best <em class="italic">compositions</em> for the object-glass of a microscope;
all the imperfections of double object-glasses, <em class="italic">taken
singly</em>, are here done away, while their thinness and agglutination
into one mass allows of their combining together almost
as if they were simple plano-convex lenses, leaving moreover
abundance of space for the illumination of opaque bodies.
<span class="xxpn" id="p251">[p251]</span></p>

<p>I must here state, that Messrs. C.’s object-glasses are all
stuck together, I believe, with fused gum-mastic, or, perhaps,
with very thick mastic varnish. This practice seems, in theory,
to be bad, most especially if the curves united together are not
of the same radius; nevertheless, practically speaking, the
process of soldering seems to me to do more good, by the obliteration
of two surfaces, and by keeping the glasses immovably
adjusted, than harm in any other way. I cannot, in fact,
discover any very sensible difference in the optical performance
of these small achromatics, whether stuck together or not. I
<em class="italic">fancy</em> that they have a little more light and clearness when
cemented, (as they certainly should have,) but cannot be very
positive. I hold it as a maxim in practical optics, as in our
common law, “de rebus non <em class="italic">apparentibus</em> et non existentibus
eadem est ratio.”</p>

<p>I may observe, that Mr. Lister has combined that marked
10, with 4, and finds the performance proportional to that of
4 and 2.</p>

<p>It will be remarked that Messrs. C., from an apparent ignorance
of the value of aperture; and perhaps impressed with the
too common and prevalent idea, that, having once obtained
distinctness and achromatism in their object-glasses, every
thing else might be accomplished by a condensation of artificial
light, have reduced their apertures to such a degree, as to
render their instrument as ineffective upon test-objects as a
common compound; for when the opening of an aplanatic glass
is cut off to the same diameter as a common one, it shows
<em class="italic">nothing more</em>, though it will certainly exhibit objects far <em class="italic">more
satisfactorily</em>. Upon the apertures of microscopic lenses their
effects entirely depend, as was remarked a long time ago by the
great Huygens. An achromatic glass is more valuable than
another, merely on account of the larger aperture it will bear,
without causing aberration, and consequent indistinctness.
Those who are in possession of Messrs. C.’s microscopes should
get the stop behind the object-glasses turned out, and procure
others to be used ad libitum, according to what the goodness
of the object-glasses will permit.</p>

<p>I feel myself called upon, however, to state, that, since the
completion of Mr. L.’s microscope, Messrs. C. <em class="italic">have enlarged the</em>
<span class="xxpn" id="p252">[p252]</span>
<em class="italic">apertures of their object-glasses to the requisite angle</em>, and have
moreover <em class="italic">arrived at the true method of adjusting them</em>, so that
they are <em class="italic">now</em> free from those objections which applied to Mr.
Lister’s, and are in all respects unexceptionably finished.</p>

<p>I know not if any dispute will ever arise hereafter, as to who
is to be considered as <em class="italic">the original maker of effective aplanatic
object-glasses for microscopes</em><a id="fnanchor_43_7" href="#fn_43_7" class="fnanchor">43</a>. It is of very little consequence
in the present instance, for it so happens that Mr. Tulley and
Messrs. Chevalier have been so totally unconnected with each
other, and have worked upon such totally different principles,
that it must be evident, on the most superficial consideration,
that both are entitled to the honour; nevertheless I apprehend
it can be proved that Mr. Tulley made an effective one before
the Chevaliers, having completed his in March 1824. The
date affixed by Chevalier to his first instrument is
1825<a id="fnanchor_44_8" href="#fn_44_8" class="fnanchor">44</a>.</p>

<div class="figc-s4">
<img src="images/i253.jpg" width="348" height="183" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It requires moreover a stretch of complaisance, not to be expected
on this side the Channel, to be enabled to admit that the
best double object-glass is (<em class="italic">taken singly</em>) effective; or that, in
consequence, Chevalier made an <em class="italic">effective one until he had enlarged
his apertures, and combined two together</em><a id="fnanchor_45_9" href="#fn_45_9" class="fnanchor">45</a>, which combination
is not to be met with in his primitive instruments. Mr.
Lister, (to whom the public is mainly indebted for the present
eclaircissement concerning Chevalier’s instrument,) has,
by a peculiar method of his own discovery, measured the
<span class="xxpn" id="p253">[p253]</span>
curves, thicknesses, and diameter, &#38;c. of that marked 14, which
I here give (unfortunately one of the least effective of the set,)
however, in all probability, the rest are constructed on the same
principle; the annexed drawing by Mr. L. will sufficiently
explain itself. Nothing can surpass the beautiful simplicity of
Chevalier’s, or rather Euler’s, curves, which, it will be observed,
are all alike<a id="fnanchor_46_10" href="#fn_46_10" class="fnanchor">46</a>. The production of <em class="italic">deep</em> achromatics
must ever be a task of some difficulty, even to those who
thoroughly understand their humours and punctilios; and unscientific
artists will, I think, be much more likely to succeed
on the French plan, than the English one. Two double object-glasses,
by themselves, are very poor things; but, when combined,
perform admirably, and will, I believe, (if the three
curves are of equal radii,) be far more easily executed than
one of the triple Tulleian construction. The dense flint-glass
of Guenard, or Frauenhofer, however, will be an indispensable
requisite, from the nature of the curvatures. A triple Tulleian
object-glass, and a thin double one of Chevalier, (a composition
first conceived and adopted by Mr. Lister,) form an excellent
combination, and give a very vivid light, without softness,
dulness, or nebulosity. This, I think, is the extreme number
of glasses which ought to be tolerated. Let it never be forgotten,
that <em class="italic">a really good triple glass will bear an aperture
quite sufficient for ninety-nine objects out of a hundred</em>. I
myself denounce the practice of combining glasses together,
<em class="italic">in all those cases where they are capable of doing their work
alone</em>. I shall always consider it as a clumsy, bungling, and
unworkmanlike method of obtaining a short focus, combined
<span class="xxpn" id="p254">[p254]</span>
with a large angle of aperture. If a man aims at perfection,
and wishes to distinguish himself in this branch of optics, let
it be done by working perfect triple glasses of 0.2 and 0.3 inch
focus, with 0.1 and 0.15 of perfect aperture, like those of
Mr. W. Tulley and Mr. Dollond, or deeper still, if he is able;
and it is with the most cordial satisfaction that I am enabled
to inform my readers, that Messrs. Chevalier (duly appreciating
the regular triple construction as the true form for
the microscope) have applied themselves diligently to the
manufacture of this species of objective, from which they have
already had excellent results. It is a fundamental principle, that
all superfluous refractions and reflections are to be avoided in
the construction of optical instruments. As a radical reformer of
microscopes, I can tolerate no abuses in them, or show any
quarter to their abettors. Messrs. Chevalier have also undertaken
the manufacture of achromatic and catadioptric microscopes,
after the fashion of those made by Professor Amici, of
Modena, which were so much and so justly admired by the
cognoscenti of this country.</p>

<p>It only remains for me to observe, that though two double-cemented
object-glasses form the most perfect <em class="italic">combination</em>
from the fewness of their surfaces, and consequent brightness
of their image, yet a fusion between the Tulleian and Eulerian
constructions seems to be the <em class="italic">most convenient</em> for general use;
by this, of course, I mean a triple glass with a double one,
to apply before it occasionally, à la Lister. Mr. Dollond and
Messrs. C. have demonstrated that two object-glasses <em class="italic">may be
combined with the best effect, which are both good, and work
well separately</em>; but Mr. Tulley has constructed a double
one, which, useless by itself, when applied over a triple one,
(made to act singly,) corrects that excess of spherical aberration
in the concave lens, (by its own excess in the convex,)
which, when the aperture is large, is the eternal vice of all the
best single and compound object-glasses for diverging rays
which I ever saw. This is perhaps the ultimatum of improvement,
though a quadruple one, on the same plan, might have
the advantage in greater light and clearness, from its simplicity,
and the paucity of its surfaces.</p>

<p>The quadruple or quintuple object-glasses are those which
<span class="xxpn" id="p255">[p255]</span>
are best adapted for the solar microscope, for they give a full-sized
field of view to this instrument, good to the edges, which
no single object-glass will do, as I have had occasion to remark
in my paper on Mr. Tulley’s aplanatics, unless converted into
a compound, by means of eye-glasses, &#38;c. This popular and
highly amusing instrument will now receive the utmost reformation
and improvement of which it is capable, and become
truly scientific in its construction: hitherto it has been a mere
toy, but one degree removed from a magic lantern.</p>

<p>I shall now allow Messrs. C. to say what they can for themselves,
and to detail the various modifications which they have
introduced into their instruments, since they executed Mr.
Lister’s order, by giving a translation of a letter I have received
from them on the subject, and shall conclude by expressing a
hope that no national or illiberal feeling has entered into the
composition of this critique, and that I have used my oil,
vinegar, and pepper in correct proportions.</p>

<p class="signature">“<em class="italic">Paris</em>, Oct. 15.</p>

<p class="first">“Sir,</p>

<p>“Accept our thanks for your extreme complaisance in offering
to publish the results obtained by us in the construction of
microscopes. Since the order executed for Mr. Lister, we have
improved those instruments last completed, by greatly enlarging
the diameter of the illuminating mirror, in order to obtain still
greater light. The prism for opaque bodies is diminished about one
half, and by a small modification in its mounting is rendered more
serviceable: the diminution of the length of the body has enabled us
to augment the magnifying powers by different eye-glasses, and the
four double object-glasses placed in a better mounting can be used
separately or in superposition, according to the pleasure of the
observer, either to form quadruple objectives, or even to combine in
a mass together. This last arrangement produces a great accession
of magnifying power, without injuring the clearness of the image or
arresting much light.</p>

<p>“You see, Sir, that we have the pleasure of coinciding perfectly
in your opinions about improvements, for we adopt the quadruple
object-glass as the best, and we give three changes
<span class="xxpn" id="p256">[p256]</span>
of
eye-pieces. The double motion given to the body of a microscope is,
in our idea, the defect of all those hitherto constructed; for, as
the optical part should remain perfectly centred with the mirror
and the diaphragms, it is evident that the least derangement of it
from this position must destroy the perfection of the image: the
stage then only should move<a id="fnanchor_47_11" href="#fn_47_11" class="fnanchor">47</a> without affecting the diaphragms
or the mirror, and in this we
<span class="xxpn" id="p257">[p257]</span>
have well succeeded in
the construction of the microscope of Sig. Amici. But all these
arrangements much augment the price, and an observer ever so little
practised will always find the object easily enough by means of his
hands.</p>

<p>“The prices of our achromatic microscopes are as
<span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<p>“<em class="italic">Achromatic microscope</em>, like Mr. Lister’s—300 francs.</p>

<p>“The same, with the latest improvements, three eye-pieces, and
camera lucida for drawing the magnified objects—400 francs.</p>

<p>“<em class="italic">Amician Microscope</em>, one horizontal achromatic, the stage
giving all the motions to the object, with a micrometer screw,
five eye-pieces, two camera lucidas, hand magnifier, frog trough,
accessary apparatus, &#38;c. <em class="italic">One catadioptric microscope</em>, mounted on
the same stand, and adapting itself to the same apparatus; the two
instruments inclosed in a mahogany case—1000 francs.</p>

<p>“We trust that the very moderate prices of these instruments,
together with the care which we bestow on their construction,
will procure us orders for them. Their superiority has been duly
recognized by the jury of the Exhibition of the Products of
Industry, which has been pleased to decree to us a silver medal.</p>

<p>“The Amician achromatic microscope is composed of a tube seven
inches long, at the extremity of which is placed a prism, which
reflects at a right angle the rays which come from the object-glass,
composed (<em class="italic">as in our microscopes executed since 1824</em>) of four
double object-glasses, which may be used separately, or two, three,
or four at a time. The stand is a square bar, which has a rackwork,
carrying a moveable stage, which, by means of adjusting screws
ingeniously disposed, permits an object to traverse the field
of view in every direction. This disposition gives the power of
determining the real dimensions of objects submitted to observation
by means of the micrometer screw, which is placed at the side, while
the camera lucida affords the means of drawing their outline, and
consequently of measuring the magnifying power.</p>

<p>“The rays proceeding from the object which have passed the
object-glass, and have been rendered horizontal by the prism, are
received by different eye-pieces disposed after the manner of
<span class="xxpn" id="p258">[p258]</span>
Ramsden. Their power can be varied. Each instrument carries six,
five of which can be attached at pleasure either to the catadioptric
or the achromatic. The deepest belonging to the reflector is a
single lens of half a French line focus, and the most powerful of
the achromatic is a line and a half.</p>

<p>“Such, we think, are the details which you required: we wish that
they may prove agreeable to you.</p>

<p>“We beg you to accept the assurance of the high consideration with
which we are, Sir,</p>

<p class="center">“Your very devoted Servants,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcaps">V<span>INCENT</span></span>

The objects employed by me in looking into the defects
and excellencies of these glasses, were an artificial star, and a
piece of enamelled dial-plate, the phenomena presented by which,
<em class="italic">when put out of focus</em>, incontestably warrant the judgment I have
pronounced upon them, as any, true optician will admit.</p>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn_42_6" href="#fnanchor_42_6">42</a>
When an object-glass is out of adjustment, its maximum
of distinctness is not in the centre of the field of view, but
somewhere else, according to circumstances.</p>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn_43_7" href="#fnanchor_43_7">43</a>
The question must naturally resolve itself into this
point, for achromatics for microscopes, (as they are called,) were
made by Dollond, Martin, and Pollard, many years ago; the only
objection to them was, that they were <em class="italic">not effective</em>, consequently,
<em class="italic">nominal only</em>, and useless. I defy any man to produce an <em class="italic">effective</em>
object-glass, which can satisfactorily be proved to have been made
before 1824.</p>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn_44_8" href="#fnanchor_44_8">44</a>
See the <em class="italic">first</em> instruction published by Messrs. C.
along with their microscopes: “Microscope Achromatique selon Euler,”
&#38;c. I apprehend there is a misdate in Messrs. C.’s letter at the
end of this paper, where they state they have made the achromatics
<em class="italic">since</em> 1824, <em class="italic">with four objectives</em>, which implies that they also
made them before that period, but in another way.</p>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn_45_9" href="#fnanchor_45_9">45</a>
Mr. C. Tulley recommended the combination of two
achromatics together from nearly the beginning of his son W.’s
labours upon them, who rejected the idea, together with myself,
as giving rise to too great a complication, <em class="italic">always supposing
that triple glasses must be used</em>. I myself combined two triple
achromatics together, for experiment sake, in a very early stage
of our proceedings, but liked not the result, though effects were
certainly produced by the composition, which could not be obtained
from the best individual triple one.</p>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn_46_10" href="#fnanchor_46_10">46</a>
The theory on which these object-glasses are constructed
is contained in a paper of Euler’s, published at St. Petersburgh, in
1774. Messrs. Chevalier have caused it to be inserted entire in the
“Bulletin de la Société d’Encouragement de Paris,” No. <span class="allcaps">CCLIV</span>., for
Aug. 1825.</p>

<p><a  class="fnlabel" id="fn_47_11" href="#fnanchor_47_11">47</a>
This is the theoretical view of the case, the practical one is
different, as frequently happens. <em class="italic">Opaque objects</em> are not affected
at all by the eccentricity of the axis of the body: nor can I
recollect that I ever felt any particular inconvenience from the
motion of the optical part, even with transparent subjects, unless
it was thrown <em class="italic">very much indeed</em> out of the axis of the illuminating
mirror. On the other hand, it is notorious that <em class="italic">living</em> aquatic
insects and animalcules are the most <em class="italic">popular</em> and <em class="italic">entertaining</em>
objects which microscopes can show. These are, for the most part,
abundantly restless; and if the stage on which they are placed has
any motion, their natural unquietness is so much exasperated, that
it becomes almost impossible to get a good observation of them at
all. I once set to work at making some drawings of a variety of new
and original objects of this class (which, I trust, will one day be
published) with a microscope having all the requisite motions applied
to its stage, and am confident that I had thrice the labour fairly
appropriate to the execution of my task from this oversight. The very
tremor produced by the transition of a carriage in the street, is
frequently sufficient to unsettle live objects when disposed to be
still and quiet, and put them in a fidget for a quarter of an hour.
It is very unfortunate that the mountings of optical instruments
are made in general by mere mechanics, who seldom or never observe
with them, and consequently know not the exigencies which occur
in practice.
<span class="figleft isize5">
<img src="images/i256.jpg" width="252" height="285" alt="" />
</span>
It is still more unfortunate, that in the science of
fitting up microscopes, an ounce of a man’s own wit is worth about
a ton of his neighbour’s. Was it not that I dislike to verify this
adage myself, I should recommend the following motion to be applied
<em class="italic">to the body</em>:—let the socket of the arm which carries it have a
smooth rotatory motion on the head of the bar in the usual way,
conjoined with another horizontal one produced by rackwork attached
to the said socket. Let the pinion which belongs to the latter
movement be made very strong, so that a lever about three inches
long may project from its centre: this is to be held in the hand,
the thumb and index finger operating on the rackwork, while the two
little fingers give a rotatory motion by working the lever end. <em class="italic">This
rapid double motion is here completely under the command of</em> one
hand, <em class="italic">while the other is at liberty to adjust the focus</em>. I know of
nothing better for general purposes, or in particular for following
the motions of live insects, &#38;c.; but when <em class="italic">only inanimate ones</em> are
to be the subject of microscopical study, I prefer the motion of the
stage, for the reasons stated by Mons. C.</p>

<h3><em class="italic">On the Existence of Chlorine in the Native Black Oxide of
Manganese.</em> By John M’Mullen, Esq. <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">I<span>N</span></span> the paper relating to this subject, which the editors of the
Quarterly Journal of Science obligingly inserted in the forty-fourth
number of that work, I described some experiments
which I had made, to show that chlorine is uniformly evolved
from the Native Black Oxide of Manganese by the action of sulphuric
acid, under certain circumstances, which I endeavoured
to detail with strict accuracy, so as to prevent any mistake or
failure in the event of the experiment being repeated.</p>

<p>Upon this paper Mr. Richard Phillips has made some observations
in the Philosophical Magazine and Annals of Philosophy
for April last, to which I am desirous of briefly adverting.
He says, “Mr. M’Mullen having observed, when sulphuric
acid is added to peroxide of manganese, that chlorine is evolved,
he conceived it might be derived from an admixture of muriate
of manganese, iron, or copper; but having washed some of the
peroxide of manganese with water, he did not find that any
chloride of silver was precipitable from it; he, therefore, concluded
that the peroxide in question contained no muriatic
salt.” If Mr. Phillips will take the trouble to refer to my
paper, he will find that this is by no means the statement which
it contains. I observed that, in order to separate any soluble
<span class="xxpn" id="p259">[p259]</span>
muriates which the oxide used might, in the first instance, have
contained, “I washed it every day, for three weeks successively,
using sometimes hot and sometimes cold water: <em class="italic">at the end of
that time</em>, I tested the water, which was <em class="italic">then</em> decanted from the
washed manganese, by the nitrate of silver, but without finding
the slightest appearance of precipitated chloride. I then poured
upon the manganese four times its weight of dilute sulphuric
acid; allowed the mixture to stand <em class="italic">for about four weeks</em>, occasionally
agitating it, and at the end of that time, found, when
the dilute acid, now of a deep crimson colour, <em class="italic">was removed
from the subsident manganese</em>, and the latter agitated, that the
most decisive evidence of the presence of chlorine was exhibited
in the vapour evolved from it.” I stated further, that I had
“carefully preserved this particular mixture, and that after
a lapse of more than twelve months, the residuary manganese,
when the supernatant acid was removed, continued to evolve
chlorine.”</p>

<p>In this experiment my object was effectually to purify the
manganese used from any soluble muriate which might by
possibility have been mixed with it: I did not, however, test
the water <em class="italic">first</em> used in washing it, but merely that which was
<em class="italic">last</em> removed from it.</p>

<p>Mr. Phillips proceeds to observe that he had prepared some
observations, and at considerable length, <em class="italic">to prove</em> that the
author of the above paper has been completely misled by “forced
analogies” and “erroneous experiments;” but that it <em class="italic">afterwards</em>
occurred to him, that it would be better to show, in a few words,
the real source of the chlorine in question, the evolution of
which from peroxide of manganese <em class="italic">he had noticed some time
previous to the publication of my papers</em>. That with this view
he had procured various specimens of the peroxide of manganese,
(one of them in the crystallized state,) which were reduced
to powder, and on the addition of sulphuric acid, chlorine was
evolved from each. That he then washed separate portions of
them with distilled water, and on the addition of nitrate of
silver to the washings, chloride of silver was immediately precipitated:
sulphuric acid being poured upon the washed peroxide,
no chlorine whatever was evolved. That he further added
sulphuric acid to an unwashed portion, and to one which had
<span class="xxpn" id="p260">[p260]</span>
been washed, and referred both to a <em class="italic">bystander</em>, who immediately
detected the odour of chlorine in the former, but not in
the latter. He then proceeds to show that the specimens of
manganese which he had made the subject of this experiment
contained a portion of lime, and he infers that the black oxide
of manganese consequently contains muriate of lime.</p>

<p>Mr. Phillips asserts that I have been misled by erroneous
experiments. My reply is, that the experiment to which he
refers, and which I have recapitulated, was carefully made,
and is truly and faithfully detailed. In what, then, is it erroneous?
It is not incompatible with that which he has produced
as a refutation of it, inasmuch as he did not wait the result for
which the perusal of my statement should have prepared him,
and which he clearly should not have anticipated. He states
that chlorine was not evolved from washed manganese at the
instant when sulphuric acid was affused upon it. This is not
a contradiction of my statement: I affirmed that, after washed
manganese had been exposed to the action of sulphuric acid
for a very considerable period, I distinctly observed the evolution
of chlorine, and that for twelve months afterwards, <em class="italic">under
the circumstances detailed</em>, this continued to be the case:—all
this I deliberately re-assert. I have frequently met with specimens
of manganese which, upon the first affusion of sulphuric
acid, gave off chlorine; but <em class="italic">in general</em>, as far as my experience
goes, <em class="italic">this is not the case</em>: were it of uniform occurrence, and
that the mixture of sulphuric acid and oxide of manganese
rendered chlorine evident to the smell, the fact <em class="italic">could not have
remained unnoticed till now</em>.</p>

<p>The observations of Mr. Phillips, to which I now refer, did
not come into my hands till about three weeks ago. It fortunately
happened that I had still preserved the specimen of
washed manganese upon which sulphuric acid had been affused,
under the circumstances already recapitulated, and it occurred
to me that this would afford occasion, as decisive as I could
desire, to put the accuracy of my original experiment, and the
conclusions drawn from it, to further proof. I am bound to
premise that this specimen of manganese, after having been in
the first washed and subjected to the action of sulphuric
acid, as already mentioned, has ever since remained in
<span class="xxpn" id="p261">[p261]</span>
the vessel in which the experiment was at first made, covered
with dilute sulphuric acid,—a period of more than eighteen
months; and it will scarcely be doubted that, in the course of
that long interval, any muriate of lime which it might have
originally contained must have been thoroughly decomposed.
Upon removing the supernatant acid, the residuary manganese
gave sensible evidence of the presence of chlorine; paper
stained with the solution of indigo in sulphuric acid was readily
bleached by it, &#38;c. I now proceeded to wash the manganese
in pure water, and continued to do so until the acid was no
longer perceptible to the taste. I then washed it three times
successively with distilled water, and after decanting off the
fluid of the last washing as closely as possible, added pure sulphuric
acid in considerable quantity, and stirred the mixture
thoroughly, after it had cooled, with a glass rod. At this time
no vapour of chlorine was evident either to the smell or to the
usual tests. The mixture was then set aside, and allowed to
stand undisturbed for ten days: at the end of that time, when
the acid was poured off, and the subsident manganese agitated,
the vapour of chlorine was as distinctly manifest as when it
was first subjected to experiment more than a year and a half
ago.</p>

<h3><em class="italic">Modern Improvements of
Horticulture</em>. <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">T<span>HAT</span></span>
gardening has always been one of the most natural, as
well as the most useful occupations of mankind, is obvious:
that it has advanced—been retarded—or flourished, according
as general taste or wants, or peculiar political, moral, or local
circumstances, were favourable or adverse, is also sufficiently
evident from all historical testimony;—but in no age has it
advanced with such rapid strides towards perfection as it has
done within the last fifty years. To bring the modern improvements
in array before the reader,—to estimate their advantages
in a public and private point of view,—to look forward from
our present elevated station to the probable results of continued,
and extended application,—may be an amusing, if not an
<span class="xxpn" id="p262">[p262]</span>
useful inquiry: it may tend to remove barriers which are only
imaginary, and by freeing the thinking powers of practitioners
from the trammels of custom, lead them forward into that
expanse of operative freedom, where much remains for the
exercise of the inquiring mind, and experimental hand, in
exploring the yet untrodden field of practicability, and calling
forth the still latent powers and susceptibilities of pregnant
nature.</p>

<p>When we turn to the history of the first ages, we hear of
a garden as soon as we hear of man; and though, from the
paucity of description, we can only form ideas of such a place
from the effusions of the poet, rather than from the detail of
the historian, yet, in judging from what still appears of aboriginal
scenery, we may conclude with Milton that a garden was
a place,</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="quotep">
“A happy rural seat of various views;</p>
<p>Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm;</p>
<p>Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind,</p>
<p>Hung amiable, and of delicious taste:</p>
<p>Betwixt them lawns—or the flow’ry lap</p>
<p>Of some irriguous valley spread her
 store.”—<em class="italic">Par. Lost</em>.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="continue">If such a place, it required care to rear the tender—to check
the luxuriant—correct the irregular—to support the burdened—extirpate
the noisome weed—and repulse the browsing animal.
Such was the only occupation of the first gardeners: for
in those highly-favoured spots, those natural paradises, (some
of which still remain in India,) where the groves which formed
the habitations also supplied the simple food of the inhabitants;
where the cocoa-nut<a id="fnanchor_48_12" href="#fn_48_12" class="fnanchor">48</a>, with its various liquors, abounded;
<span class="xxpn" id="p263">[p263]</span>
where the date, the mango, tamarind, and lime dropped in
profusion into the hand; where the melon tribe upon, and the
nutritious yam beneath the surface of the bountiful soil, were
all spontaneously supplied without care, and without toil:—in
such circumstances, neither sagacity to contrive, nor ability to
perform, were necessary, further than collecting and preserving
those spontaneous gifts of nature.</p>

<p>But population increased; and when mankind became
translocated to regions less favourable to vegetation, and where
the spontaneous productions of the earth were insufficient for
their subsistence, then the business of the planter and cultivator
became a necessary occupation; and hence gardening would
begin to assume a systematic form.</p>

<p>As improvements, and the times in which they took place,
have descended together in continuous and collateral streams,
the narration may be divided into three periods, viz.:—From
the earliest ages to the beginning of the sixteenth century;—from
the beginning of the sixteenth century to the end
of the seventeenth;—and from that period to the present
time.</p>

<p>We have already hinted at what were probably natural, or
aboriginal gardens: the account is so far feasible from the
fact, that such places and productions may be met with on
the peninsula of India, at the present day: true it is, they
cultivate rice, and some few inferior plants, where they have
opportunity, and use them along with their wild fruits; but
when they cannot procure these cultivated necessaries, (which
sometimes happens,) they must rely on the natural productions.
It is necessary to add, that some of the castes, from religious
principle, abhor the use of almost any kind of animal food;
and, therefore, vegetables are their sole support.</p>

<p>From Egyptian and Jewish history, we learn that gardens
<span class="xxpn" id="p264">[p264]</span>
were an appendage of the palaces of their princes, and other
great men, for personal solace and gratification; but how far
the art was systematized, either in knowledge or practice, history
is silent. Throughout the Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, and
Macedonian empires, we learn but little more than that ornamental
gardening was carried to an extravagant height in their
artificial formation; insomuch that one of the Babylonian princes
built what were called “hanging gardens,” that is, a vast and
lofty pyramidal structure on arches, arcades with terraces
surmounted by other arcades, and carried up in gradations to
a great height. The terraces being planted with the choicest
trees, presented to the distant spectator a verdant hill of foliage
in the midst of a large city, and lifted the sovereign proprietor
far above the noise and intrusive notice of his vassals below; at
the same time, yielding him all the sweets, seclusion, and quiet
of the country, even in the purlieu of his palace! The idea of
such an ornamented and elevated structure for a mighty sovereign
was certainly sublime, and far surpassing all that has
been yet done (though it has been suggested by Mr. Loudon)
in the western world; and though only a monument of wealth
and personal pride, prompted by conjugal regard, and entirely
artificial, was certainly proper for the place where it stood,
worthy of the prince who erected, and the extensive empire to
which it belonged.</p>

<p>Throughout a long-following period, and up to the time of
the Romans, we learn nothing particular respecting gardens,
only, that among the Jews, they had gardens for herbs, vineyards,
and even gardens for cucumbers: but as frequent allusions
are made to them, it is probable that gardening had then
become a distinct calling, as we find it was among the Romans,
as soon as their extensive conquests were secured.</p>

<p>As the arts and arms of the Romans went together, no
doubt a very wide circulation of all that was known of gardening
in Italy, was transferred thence. Their writers on rural
affairs preferred <em class="italic">agri</em> to <em class="italic">horti</em>culture; but their sound knowledge
of the former shews no inconsiderable share of acquaintance
with the principles of the latter; and as their practice,
as well as the seeds of their products, would be introduced
wherever the climate permitted, it is more than probable they
<span class="xxpn" id="p265">[p265]</span>
laid the foundation of British gardening. The rules and examples
left by them, were probably continued, with occasional
accessions to the stock both of practice and production, throughout
the Heptarchy, the domination of the Saxons, Danes, and
Normans: but these troublous times were not favourable to
the prosecution of the arts of peace; and it is not likely much
advancement in the art took place until the Norman power
was fully established; and even then their castellated mansions
precluded any extensive adaptation of garden, from the necessity
of forming the glacis, for the greater security of the baronial
hall: and though it is probable that, at this time, not a
dwelling, from the regal palace to the cottage, but had a garden
of some size or other, yet the best practice was confined to
the monasteries, and other religious corporations of those days,
all over Christendom. Their education and leisure, their foreign
intercourse, their interest in the tithes, and their love of superior
vegetables and condiments, on the many days they were restricted
from indulging in the consumption of animal food, all contributed
to incline the monks to prosecute gardening on the most approved
plans. Thus, Italy, Spain, and Germany became famous for
their superior culinary vegetables, as France was for improved
fruits; indeed, when war depopulated or devastated a country,
and when the gardens of the château became a sacrifice to
offensive or defensive operations, and when the potageries of
the hamlets were trodden under foot and destroyed by a licentious
soldiery, the gardens of the religious houses were often
spared, and, consequently, many roots and fruits found there
an asylum, which was denied them in less privileged places.</p>

<p>In looking over the lists of plants cultivated in those days,
we find the names of a great majority of the common sorts
now in use, as well culinary, as for the table or the press, with
a great addition of physical plants, it being then a prevalent
supposition that remedies for all the ailments of the human
frame were existent in the vegetable kingdom, if they could be
detected; the cultivation and gathering of simples, therefore,
was a business which employed many heads and many hands:
even the Corinthian pillars of the noble profession of physic
were not entirely free from that malaria, which was generated
in the fumes of the herbalist’s shop!
<span class="xxpn" id="p266">[p266]</span></p>

<p>Ornamental gardening had hardly showed its graceful head;
the little that had been done of this in England, was only in
imitation of the Italian school, though without their accompaniments
of splendid architecture, classical sculpture, and costly
fountains. Such a style, in the near neighbourhood of a
palace or mansion, is imposing and suitable, but the outskirts
of such gardens, which should have been gradually blended
with and into the free and beautiful forms of nature, were
bounded and deformed by tortuous labyrinths, by complicated
folds of nicely-clipped hedges, involving each other for no purpose
than affording seclusion from the “licentious eye,” or a
“maze to the intruding foot.”</p>

<p>It may be observed as somewhat unaccountable, the excellent
taste of their landscape painters was never transferred from
the canvass to their style of ornamental gardening. But so it
was: the people who had all kinds of assistance from artists
of the first order, and from classical and picturesque association
within their own territory, long remained blind to what
was so natural and so manifestly within their reach!</p>

<p>In useful and profitable gardening, the fine climate of Italy
gave great facility for successful cultivation of a profusion of
the finest fruits, and being an advanced post for the reception
of all valuable plants from both Asia and Africa, it much
sooner than other European countries possessed culinary vegetables
in great variety, and of salad-herbs a numerous list.</p>

<p>From the commencement of the sixteenth century the improvements
in gardening began to take the form of a system.
The increasing splendour of the English court, during the reigns
of the virgin queen and her father, and the princely establishments
of some of her courtiers, called the art of gardening into
notice and repute, and gave an impulse to the yet dormant
powers of horticultural practicability. Continental artists were
generally employed in laying out the greater works. The sum
of their professional ability was chiefly geometrical, an exact
knowledge of straight lines, squares, and curves; they could
line out a polygonal basin to a hair’s breadth, and construct a
many-tiered jet d’eau in the midst. Such, however, were the
principal features admitted into, and which constituted the style
of those days, and continued through that and the succeeding
<span class="xxpn" id="p267">[p267]</span>
century. In the latter (the seventeenth), and during the
domestic broils which then convulsed the kingdoms, gardening
appears to have been, as to style, almost stationary. In the
mean time, however, the Reformation had been silently working
salutary effects, not only in the deliverance of men from a
servile religious thraldom, but also from the dogmas of precedential
custom, and by imbuing them with a spirit of independence
with respect to others, gave, what was better, a <em class="italic">self-dependence</em>
in exertion, whether of mind or action; and, after
a few years of revolutionary excess, and abuse of this inestimable
acquisition of mental freedom, at last, in 1688, settled
down into that rational state of composure, which, with few
interruptions, has happily remained to the present day.</p>

<p>Then it was that gardening, in all its branches, was patronised
and encouraged. Tournefort in France, and Ray in
England, enlightened the public by their description, enumeration,
and classification of plants. Evelyn called attention to
the usefulness and national value of forest trees; several
authors developed the mysteries of kitchen-garden and orchard
management; collections of exotic plants were made, and
glass-cases built for their reception; floriculture received a
share of the gardener’s attention; and in short, there seemed
to be, about this time, a general movement by united exertion
to gain what had been previously neglected, and complete
what had been only feebly attempted.</p>

<p>The accession of William and Mary to the British throne
very naturally introduced Dutch gardening and architecture.
The old Italian and French styles received very little, if any,
amendment. The avenue, the canal, the rectangular clumps
and borders, the shelves and slopes, the terrace, with its stairs,
were all maintained and extended, the whole surrounded by
exactly-clipped hedges, and bedotted with fanciful and unnaturally
cut trees. This expensive and ridiculous fashion had
its admirers for a time, but at last fell into disrepute, not by a
bull or anathema, but chiefly by the keen sarcasm of a Pope!</p>

<p>Kitchen-gardens were improved by additional brick-walls
for the more delicate kinds of fruit, as vines, figs, peaches,
nectarins, apricots, &#38;c. Hot-beds were in general use, and,
many hot-houses were erected for different kinds of the above
<span class="xxpn" id="p268">[p268]</span>
as well as for the pine-apple. In those days our fruit-lists
contained twenty sorts, of which there were many varieties. Of
culinary vegetables there were, of roots eighteen, of shoots
four, of leaves fourteen, of flowers three, of seeds three, of pods
two, and of herbs for all purposes twenty-five.</p>

<p>From that period, the commencement of the eighteenth
century, every succeeding year brought forth new objects of
the gardener’s care, and improved operations for his imitation.
The acquirements of natural science, radiating from such a
character as Sir Hans Sloane, whose theories were imbibed
and confirmed by the practical abilities of Philip Miller,
were, at that time, like the orb of day bursting from behind
a cloud! Scientific light and practical life were shed on all
around, and the foundation was then laid, by their united
means, on which has been raised almost all the varied structure
of modern horticultural improvement. It would be impossible,
as needless, to give the names of the authors, who, from this
period, showed themselves in print on the subject of gardening,
for, were the respective merits of their literary labours noticed,
and the successive discoveries and advances chronicled, the
amount would be voluminous indeed. But the following celebrated
names cannot, in justice to their memories, be omitted.
The great Linnæus was deservedly at the head of the botanical
branch of gardening; Miller, with his satellites, Gordon, Lee,
and Aiton were at that of practical botany, as well as of all
the other parts of operative gardening; and, as a leading
orchardist, Kennedy, and many others on miscellaneous subjects,
produced respectable directories and kalendars.</p>

<p>The improvement of ornamental gardening kept pace with
that of the more useful. Soon as the old style of rigid formality
had been exposed, it was exploded; more refined principles
of taste prevailed; its outlines became better defined;
it was found that there are certain fixed principles in nature,
on which the elements of true taste are naturally (not capriciously)
founded; that delight and gratification to the eye, or
mind, can only arise from the harmony and fitness of the combinations
of art or design; that the sensations of beauty and
sublimity can only be conveyed by congruous associations of
parts to the whole; and that the incidents found in
<span class="xxpn" id="p269">[p269]</span>
conjunction in nature, should be the objects of imitation of the gardener’s,
as they had long been that of the painter’s art, with
this exception, that in the immediate vicinity of the mansion
as much of the old style should be retained as will harmonize
with the necessary artificial façade of the architecture; but
soon as departed from these creations of art, let then appear
the varied flow of nature’s devious garb.</p>

<p>The art of painting had, in the best schools, proceeded on
such principles, and the formation of real scenery was improved
from what was so prominent in the fictitious. Some painters,
even Claude Lorraine himself, have occasionally erred, from
what may be called <em class="italic">exuberance of design</em>, in producing extreme
effect, by introducing lights which never can be seen by day
or night, at dawn or twilight; by trees which never existed,
and by forms<a id="fnanchor_49_13" href="#fn_49_13" class="fnanchor">49</a> which had only an imaginary existence. Landscape
gardeners, too, in the transition from the tame to the
more natural style, have run into error, by imitating admirable
incidents frequently seen in nature’s works, forgetting that their
value springs entirely from their having happened by chance,
but, as works of art, lose all their interest, and become insignificant.</p>

<p>We are now arrived on the confines of our own times, of
which we will take a general view, and which will sufficiently
show the accumulated assemblage of horticultural objects, productions,
and knowledge; and which will also give, what was
proposed, a comparative survey of the extent of our improvements.</p>

<p>And first, as to the highest department, Botany. Before the
sexual system of Linnæus was fairly established, (though it
spread far and wide by the literary labours of Hudson, Lee,
Curtis, and several other able contemporary writers, both in
England and on the continent,) defects were found in it, and
not only as to the terms of distinction, but also to its bringing
together, in the classification, plants which appeared, from their
<span class="xxpn" id="p270">[p270]</span>
exterior habit and qualities, to have no natural affinity to each
other. This Linnæus was aware of himself, and left some
fragments of a natural arrangement, but which he did not live
to complete. This, or the idea of it, however, was taken up
by Jussieu, a French botanist, and completed as far, perhaps,
as it can be; and though, in our present botanical publications,
both systems are continued, yet it is likely that Jussieu’s simplified
system will, in time, supersede the other, though the
curious fact on which that of Linnæus was founded will never
be forgotten, because of its practical use in the amelioration of
fruits. Botanical publications, under the various names of
Hortuses, Floras, Monographs, and of every country and district
under the skies, and since the promulgation of Jussieu’s
system, monographs, under the titles of Geraniaceæ, Cistineæ,
&#38;c., flow in periodical floods from the press, crowd the bookseller’s
shelves, and thence find their way to every elegant
drawing-room in the kingdom.</p>

<p>This additional call on the business of the press, as well as
upon the talent of the artist, arises from the fashionable and
refined bias of the public taste for this rational and delightful
study. To extend botanical collections, and the desire to possess
every vegetable beauty, pervaded the whole community:
hence expeditions to distant lands by collectors; hence the
extension and encouragement of nursery business; hence have
sprung up chartered societies and associations for the encouragement
of botany and gardening all over the realm; so that
vegetable beauties and curiosities are now to be seen in British
collections, from every region of the known world.</p>

<p>Neither has the occult subject of botanical physiology been
neglected; many curious facts connected with the organisation,
structure, functions, and qualities of plants, have been ascertained:
but still there remains much for the employment of the
naturalist’s mind on this difficult subject.</p>

<p>Landscape gardening is not so much “the rage” as it was
twenty or thirty years ago: national circumstances, perhaps,
may be the cause; but its principles are much better understood.
The errors of Kent and Brown, and their followers,
have been corrected by the works and writings of Repton, and
the critiques of Knight and Price, whose theories have been
<span class="xxpn" id="p271">[p271]</span>
carried into practice by Loudon and others; and nothing will
prevent the universal adoption of their principles, but the difficulty
of giving the foreground from <em class="italic">home walks</em> the extreme
degree of ruggedness so much admired, and even indispensable
to the painter. Fern, (unless we can introduce some uncommon
foreign variety,) burdock, kexes, cannot be admitted into dressed
ground; nor have we any plants in cultivation which would well
answer the purpose; true, we have the rhubarb, one or two sorts
of thistles, eryngiums, palma Christi, and gourds with their ample
leaves: but these would only appear intruders, and misplaced:
but much may be done by a judicious disposition of our common
shrubs, so as to conceal the traces of the spade and line,
and give all our combinations of land, wood, and water that
flowing character, which is so true to nature, and so pleasing
to the refined eye of taste.</p>

<p>Floriculture, which has been imported from France and
Holland, is also intensely followed about London, as well as in
our manufacturing provinces. Authors have creditably appeared
in this line too; and our annual blows of flowers, both
home-cultivated and imported, are at once rich and costly.
Tulips, hyacinths, narcissuses, ranunculuses, and anemones, are
the principal bed flowers: but roses, stocks, dahlias, chrysanthemums,
and even poppies, are out of number. Flowering
shrubs, both within and without doors, are eminently rich and
various, and astonish as much by the splendour of their colours
as by their elegant forms and number.</p>

<p>Orcharding has declined during the last fifty years: first,
because of the gradual deterioration of the trees, and precariousness
of the crops; next, from the improved way of agricultural
labourers’ manner of living. This change renders the
use of small cider and perry less necessary in a farm-house,
causing an increased consumption of malt liquor; and this
again, occasioning a greater demand for barley, at once pleases
both the farmer and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Thus
the cultivation of orchard fruit (except cherries<a id="fnanchor_50_14" href="#fn_50_14" class="fnanchor">50</a>) has greatly
fallen off; and the decayed state of the old, and difficulty of
<span class="xxpn" id="p272">[p272]</span>
raising new orchards, has given a check to such exertion, except
in places at a distance from the metropolis, where orchards
have suffered less from decay, and where the habits of the
cider drinkers are more inveterate. Mr. Knight, the President
of the Horticultural Society, has written copiously on this subject,
and very properly considers the cultivation of orchard
fruit as a national object; and by his example has done as
much, nay, much more, than any other gentleman in the kingdom,
to restore our orchards to what they used to be, and what
they may be,—and it is hoped his excellent instructions will
not be thrown away.</p>

<p>Kitchen-gardening, the most important and useful branch
of the subject, next demands attention; and here we are gratified
with a fine display of the efficacy of perseverance, the
success of experience, and the triumphs of skill. In every
month of the year, in spite of the winter’s frost or summer’s
sun, our tables are supplied with wholesome and agreeable
vegetables:—of roots we have fourteen sorts; of stems, shoots,
and leaf-stalks, seven; of leaves, eight; of flowers, four: of
culinary fruits we have sixteen; of seeds and pods, six; of
condimental herbs we have twenty-nine; and of herbs and
seeds for confections there are seven, besides various fruit: of
roots, leaves, flowers, and fruit, for salads, there are in cultivation
twenty-two kinds; and various sorts of plants for medicine
and distillation.</p>

<p>Of table-fruit there are above twenty different species, and
of these numberless varieties, extending to several hundreds,
or even thousands, of various excellency and value.</p>

<p>A few tropical and foreign fruits, not included in the above,
have been cultivated in tolerable perfection in Europe within
these few years, viz. the Chinese loquat and litchee, the custard
apple, mangosteen, and mango, &#38;c.; and there is no
doubt, if these fruits could be worked on some hardier kindred
stock, and a suitable place formed for them in a stove, they
might be cultivated with the same success as the anana.</p>

<p>In the forcing department of gardening, wonders have been
accomplished. By this application of art, we appropriate to
ourselves an almost perfect imitation of any of the warmer
<span class="xxpn" id="p273">[p273]</span>
climates: heat, that powerful agent in the development of vegetation,
we can have in any degree, by stoves, by fermenting substances,
and from the steam of boiling water: light, a no less
necessary agent in the maturation of fruits, we combine with
the former, by glazed houses and frames.</p>

<p>The various expedients for obtaining the necessary degree of
heat, are, first, the most simple method of a stove, with its flue
passing through or round the floor of the house, and this for
warming the air within; but in this case, as the roots of the
plants do not sufficiently, it is supposed, receive the proper
degree of heat, various fermenting substances, as recent stable-yard
dung, tanners’ bark, oak and other leaves of trees, &#38;c. are
formed into beds, on which the compost of earth is placed, as
in hot-bed frames, or in which the pots containing the plants
are placed, or plunged, as in a hot-house. To obtain the same
effect, borders within houses are formed for the roots, having
an excavated heat-chamber beneath, supplied by simple stove
flues, or from the fermenting substances above named, or from
steam admitted for the purpose. This mode of supplying an
equal degree of heat to the roots, as well as to the leaves and
branches of a plant, is plausible, and cannot be far wrong,
because it has been attended with success: but there is,
perhaps, more attributed to it than it deserves, because the
region or stratum of the soil, which is naturally occupied by
roots, differs, in respect of temperature, much less over the
whole surface of our globe, than is commonly imagined. The
heat of the air in different latitudes ranges from several degrees
below zero to 110 degrees of Fahrenheit’s scale; but the temperature
of the earth eighteen inches below the surface, it is
probable, does not vary more than ten or fifteen. In England
spring water varies only two degrees, viz. from 42 degrees in
summer to 40 degrees in winter; and the effects of our hardest
frosts very rarely penetrate deeper than nine inches; but it is
necessary to observe, that, in such cases, as well as in hotbeds,
we <em class="italic">force</em> as well as defend; and probably, by such mode of
applying heat and moisture, nutritious gases may be communicated,
which may be no small advantage. Besides, the
atmosphere of the house can (as is done) be impregnated
with the same qualities and degrees of heat and humidity
<span class="xxpn" id="p274">[p274]</span>
(a
most necessary accompaniment<a id="fnanchor_51_15" href="#fn_51_15" class="fnanchor">51</a>,) which may be generated
below.</p>

<p>Light is a most potent agent in the maturation of vegetables:
united with a moderate degree of cold, it is much more effectual
in progressive vegetation, than the necessary degree of heat
with darkness. Exposure to light is indispensable to plants:
and, therefore, our glass cases are formed to admit as much as
possible. Within these few years, the endeavour to gain an
accession of light by reducing the dimensions of the wooden
scantling of hot houses suggested the idea of metallic frames;
and for the concentration of the sun’s rays, horizontal as well
as vertical curvilinear roofs have been constructed. Lightness
to the eye, durability, imperceptible expansion, and glazed with
panes, cut like segments of circles, to facilitate the passing off of
condensed water, with complete command of ventilation, are an
assemblage of properties, always as desirable as necessary; and
as they may be cast in the most elegant forms, and protected
by paint, they add greatly to the ornament of the garden.
Beautiful as these buildings are, some little disappointment has
taken place respecting them: it has been experienced, that
the intensity of the sun’s light, or heat, has been found detrimental
to the tender inmates, and that shading is as necessary
in bright, as light is in cloudy weather. Certain it is, that in the
winter season, when light and heat are most desirable, no fear
need be entertained from this circumstance; and it ought to
be considered, that in our summer, we have at least, daily, <em class="italic">four
hours</em> more sun than intertropical plants have at home: of
course, they have less time for their evening’s repose, (which
all plants more or less require); besides, it should be thought
of, that all plants are not equally formed to sustain such a
blaze of light; “some affect the sun and some the shade;”
such as the pine-apple<a id="fnanchor_52_16" href="#fn_52_16" class="fnanchor">52</a>, and orange, which require “a warm
<span class="xxpn" id="p275">[p275]</span>
shade;” and perhaps all plants which present a large reflecting
surface of foliage to the sun, are content with a smaller share
of his direct rays. These observations attended to, sun-shades
may be applied for occasional use, and with the plants at a
proper distance from the glass, will certainly secure them from
all the inconvenience of such buildings, while none of the
advantages are lost.</p>

<p>The kitchen-garden range of buildings includes pine-stoves,
vineries, houses for peaches, and nectarines, figs, and cherries,
hot-walls, pits for succession pines, melons, cucumbers; besides
store pits for roots, tender vegetables, salading, &#38;c., as well as
frames for many purposes of cultivation. Mushrooms are
usually raised in sheds behind the houses. The hot-houses are
also used for growing early culinary vegetables, and small fruits
in pots.</p>

<p class="center">[To be continued.]</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn_48_12" href="#fnanchor_48_12">48</a>
The cocoa palm is rather a
gigantic herb than a tree: the stem rises
to a great height, of a strongly tough fibrous substance, but never so
indurated as timber, though it is used in the construction of houses. It
has no branches; but is crowned with from five to seven ample compound
leaves, forming an umbrella-like head. The spatha issues from the
centre, and soon falls pendent between and below the footstalks of the
leaves, where it flowers and ripens the fruit. The nut is enveloped in a
thick brown fibrous husk, which opens to shed it when fully ripe. The
nut, when opened, yields two liquids, which are nutritious, and accounted
delicacies: the first is the milk which runs out; the next is the cream
which is procured by being scooped off the kernel with a spoon: this is
of thick consistence, and much resembles the cream of milk. After these
remains the perfectly-formed layer of kernel attached to the shell, and
which is used along with the liquids as an article of food. But another
most pleasant beverage, called toddy, is obtained from this palm, and
which constitutes the chief value of the plant. The fruit is sacrificed to
procure this; soon as the frond becomes pendent, the extremity is cut
off, and a narrow-necked vessel is slung thereto to receive the streaming
sap. This, both before and after being fermented, is an agreeable and
refreshing drink. It also yields an ardent spirit by distillation, but of
which the natives deny themselves the use.</p>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn_49_13" href="#fnanchor_49_13">49</a>
In Martin’s painting of the Paphian Bower, though a fine
composition, the roots of the tree, on the left of the foreground,
are too much out of the ground. The accidental exposure of roots
on the bank of a stream, or high-road, and their buttress-like
departure from the trunk, are legitimate objects for the pencil; but
their ramifications pourtrayed on the surface of the ground, is as
ridiculous as unnatural.</p>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn_50_14" href="#fnanchor_50_14">50</a>
It is said that many of the Caroon
cherries brought to Covent-garden
market, are bought up for the purpose of colouring wine on the
Continent.</p>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn_51_15" href="#fnanchor_51_15">51</a>
The admission of humidity into
forcing-houses is attended by the
most salutary consequences: it counteracts the bad effects of fire-heat,
and is inimical to many insects. For this purpose, a steam-supplying
apparatus is added to the best-constructed hot-houses, productive of the
greatest advantages.</p>

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn_52_16" href="#fnanchor_52_16">52</a>
It has long been observed by gardeners,
that the pine-apple always
does best in forcing-pits, merely from the circumstance of there being
more shade.</p>

<em class="italic">Chemical Manipulation, being Instructions to
Students in Chemistry, on the Methods of performing Experiments of
Demonstration, or of Research, with accuracy and success By</em>
Michael Faraday, F.R.S., &#38;c. <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">W<span>E</span></span>
will not positively assert that no one except Mr. Faraday
could have written this book, but we are of opinion that
there are very few chemists adequate to such a task, which
has manifestly required a considerable share of practical
skill, much deep and theoretical knowledge, and no small
degree of patience and perseverance, more especially shown
in the clearness of the details, and the perspicuous manner
in which he has managed to describe prolix and difficult
processes. The work moreover fills up a chasm in chemical
literature, by embodying almost all that is important relating
to chemical manipulation scattered through the writings of
others; while the author’s extensive experience has enabled
him to correct their faults, and to present the student and
operator with many new and important facts and processes,
by which the researches of the laboratory are most essentially
facilitated.</p>

<p>Such is our general opinion of the treatise before us, and
we are persuaded that those who are capable of appreciating
its merits will agree in our decision; but it is not so easy to
<span class="xxpn" id="p276">[p276]</span>
substantiate our judgment by quotations, in consequence of
the general didactic character of the book, and the mutual
dependence and connexion of its different parts. We shall
attempt, however, to give the general reader an outline of its
contents, and point out such parts to the chemist as we conceive
particularly useful and worthy attention.</p>

<p>The importance of readiness and dexterity in the performance
of experiments has been duly estimated for more than
a century. The writings of Black, Cavendish, Priestley, and
especially Scheele, as opposed to those of their predecessors,
show that they had acquired considerable facility in attaining,
by simple and economical means, those ends which had before
consumed much time and much expense in their accomplishment:
but it is only of late years that the refinements of
manipulation have been carried towards perfection; and the
researches carried on in the laboratory of the Royal Institution
have been not a little conducive to this improvement:
to no one, however, is this part of the science more indebted
than to Dr. Wollaston, whose skill in what may be called
microscopic chemistry is consummate, and who has a host of
humble but industrious imitators. So essential, indeed, is
the attainment of correct methods of manipulation to the
progress of chemical science, that many entire trains of
research are exclusively dependent upon it for success. It is
true that it must always be subordinate to genius and invention;
yet the person who could only devise, without knowing
how to perform, would comparatively be able to lend little
aid to the extension and usefulness of knowledge: and were it
not an invidious task, we might be able to show that some of
the greatest discoveries and improvements of the science
have originated in dexterity of experiment, rather than in
profundity of design. By tact, therefore, in manipulation, a
considerable advantage is gained, independent of that resulting
from an acquaintance with the principles of the science;
and this is so considerable, that, of two persons of equal
talent and information in other respects, he who is the best
manipulator will soon be in advance of the other; the one
will draw just inferences with accuracy and rapidity, while
the other will be lost in doubt, and often led into error.
Mr. Faraday has pointed out several other cases of prominent
advantage, arising from skilful manipulation, especially when
very small quantities of matter are to be operated upon, and
where accurate conclusions are of more than ordinary importance,
as in testing for arsenic and other poisons on judicial
occasions. When the substance under examination is rare,
<span class="xxpn" id="p277">[p277]</span>
as often happens, the facility of working with small quantities
is also of much importance, as otherwise the opportunity of
gaining information may be lost, or only retained at great
expense. “There existed,” says our author, “in the British
Museum a small fragment of a black stone, the source and
history of which was unknown: it was unique, no other specimen
being in the Museum, or known to be in existence; yet
as it presented some peculiar characters, Mr. Hatchett was
induced to examine it, and, working with a portion of the stone
weighing not more than two hundred grains, he was enabled
to discover in it a new metal, which he distinguished, by its
various characters, from all those previously known, and
which he named Columbium. Ekeberg afterwards discovered
a metal, which he named Tantalium, conceiving it to
have been observed and distinguished for the first time by
himself; but Dr. Wollaston, who examined it, and compared
it with columbium, was able to identify it with that metal,
although he had not more than five grains of the stone from
the British Museum upon which to make his experiments.”</p>

<p>In short, there can be but one opinion respecting the first-rate
importance of expertness in manipulation, and neatness,
dexterity, and efficacy of experimenting. These are the subjects
to which the present volume is directed, and which will,
therefore, form a valuable accompaniment to the more general
and systematic works. They are discussed under the
following general
<span class="nowrap">heads:—</span></p>

<ul class="ulblk">
<li><em class="italic">The conveniences and requisites of a laboratory</em>.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Chemical apparatus, and its uses</em>.</li>
<li><em class="italic">The methods of performing chemical operations</em>.</li>
<li><em class="italic">The facilities acquired by practice; and,</em></li>
<li><em class="italic">The causes which make experiments fail or succeed</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The description of a laboratory is followed by two long
and well-written sections on the arts of weighing and measuring,
in which the account of the methods of determining
specific gravities, and of the general management of a delicate
balance, are well deserving the student’s attentive perusal:
indeed, there are no operations which are more frequently performed
in a slovenly and careless manner, than those in which
scales and weights are concerned; and we should advise the
tyro to sit down with his balance and this book before him,
and practise the manipulations which it explains.</p>

<p>The fourth section, on the sources and management of heat,
is devoted to the construction and management of different
kinds of furnaces, lamps, blowpipes, thermometers, and pyrometers,
and abounds in useful hints, and in the details of
<span class="xxpn" id="p278">[p278]</span>
practical information; and the same remark applies to the
succeeding sections on comminution and solution—indeed, we
were surprised at finding so much to be taught in regard to
these very simple operations. The seventh, eighth, and
ninth sections treat of distillation and sublimation, precipitation,
and filtration. Here, and indeed throughout the work,
the wood-cuts are particularly distinct and well executed.
In the section on crystallization, the uses of that process are
enumerated; and to this succeeds an account of evaporation.
All these operations are extremely well investigated and described,
both as to their principles and as to the most proper
means of effecting them; a number of curious circumstances
are pointed out, by which their results are influenced, and
by which certainty and success may be insured.</p>

<p>The uses of coloured tests are explained and illustrated in
the twelfth section. Of coloured liquids the author chiefly
recommends the infusion of red cabbage; and as it is not only
a very good test for private experiments but of excellent
service to the public lecturer in rendering certain changes of
composition visible to an audience, it may be worth while
extracting the directions for preparing it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“583. The only substance of the kind, perhaps, worth keeping in
solution, is an acid infusion of red cabbage. For its preparation,
one or more red cabbages should be cut into strips, and boiling
water poured upon the pieces; a little dilute sulphuric acid is to
be added, and the whole well stirred: it is then to be covered and
kept hot as long as possible, or, if convenient, should be heated
nearly to boiling, for an hour or two, in a copper or earthen
vessel. The quantity of water to be added at first should be
sufficient to cover the cabbage, and the sulphuric acid should be
in the proportion of about half an ounce of strong oil of vitriol
by measure to each good-sized plant. This being done, the fluid
should be separated and drained off, and as much more hot water
poured on as will cover the solid residue, adding a very little
sulphuric acid. The whole is to be closed up, and suffered to
stand until cold, and then the liquid poured off and added to the
former infusion. The cabbage may now be thrown away. The infusion
is to be evaporated to one half or one third its first bulk, poured
into a jar, allowed to settle, and the clear red fluid decanted
and preserved in bottles. The residue may have water added to
it, the solid part be allowed to subside, the clear liquor drawn
off, evaporated and added to the former, or it may be dismissed
altogether. This solution will keep for a year. When
<span class="xxpn" id="p279">[p279]</span>
required for use, the acid of a small portion of it should be
neutralized by caustic potash, or soda, (not by ammonia,) when it
will assume an intensely deep blue colour, and will, in most cases,
require dilution with twelve or fourteen parts of water. The red
liquor of pickle cabbage will, occasionally, answer the uses of the
solution, and is, when required for service, to be neutralized in a
similar manner.”</p></div>

<p>For test-papers, litmus and turmeric are the most essential,
and several precautions in preparing and using them are here
pointed out, which, though apparently trivial, are, in fact,
extremely important in insuring correct conclusions. We
transcribe a part of the account of the applications of these
coloured papers, as a specimen of the clear minuteness with
which the details of the work are given, and as a sample of
the author’s general method and style, where subjects of
much greater intricacy are to be explained.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“591. In using these test papers with a fluid suspected to contain
free acid or alkali, or knowing that one of these substances is
predominant, to ascertain which is so, all that is necessary is to
moisten them with the liquid, and observe the change: if the fluid
be acid, the blue colour of the litmus will immediately become red;
if alkaline, the yellow colour of the turmeric will be changed to a
brown. The moistening may be effected by dipping the paper into the
liquid; but a better method is to touch the edge of the slip with
a rod dipped in the fluid. In the latter case there is no risk of
contamination to the fluid from the paper, and only a very minute
quantity of the liquid is used at once.</p>

<p>“592. These trials must be made by day-light; artificial light not
permitting that just estimation of the changes by which the presence
of a small excess of acid or alkali is to be determined. As the
proportion of free acid or alkali diminishes, the intensity of the
new tint produced upon the paper is also diminished; and when in
very small quantity, it requires considerable attention before a
decision can be arrived at. The test paper should occasionally be
touched with pure water in the immediate neighbourhood of the part
where the solution has been applied, for any change in appearance
that may have occurred, not due to mere moistening, is then readily
perceived.</p>

<p>“593. Although acid is generally tested for by litmus paper,
and alkali by turmeric paper, yet the former is sometimes used
advantageously for the latter purpose, being first slightly
reddened, either by exposure to the air, or by momentary contact
with muriatic acid fumes. When the
<span class="xxpn" id="p280">[p280]</span>
paper thus modified
is used to detect a free alkali, instead of turmeric paper, that
substance is indicated by the restoration of the original blue
colour. Litmus paper is best slightly reddened for this use, by
putting a drop or two of muriatic acid into a large jar, allowing
it to stand a few minutes, and then bringing the paper towards the
mouth of the jar, or carefully placing it within: so soon as the
blue tint has become slightly reddened, the paper should be removed
for use. If too much acid be imparted to the paper, the delicacy
of its indications is injured, because of the greater quantity of
alkali required to neutralize the acid, and restore the blue colour.
For the same reason a paper free from alkali or carbonate of lime
has been recommended for the preparation of these tests: for these
impurities, combining with a minute portion of acid, neutralize it,
and thus prevent that delicacy of indication which the test paper
ought and may be made to possess.”</p></div>

<p>The mode of determining the value of alcaline substances,
or “alcalimetry,” is described at length in this section. Our
readers, however, will here recollect that there is an error
respecting the specific gravity of the acid, which Mr. Faraday
has corrected at page 221 of the present volume of this Journal.
The thirteenth section is allotted to crucible operations,
and the fourteenth to furnace tube operations. They are
full of minute and admirable instructions, evidently deduced
from long experience, and detailed with the same precision
and clearness which we have already eulogised. The fifteenth
section, which occupies nearly a hundred pages, relates to
“pneumatic manipulation, or management of gases.” Every
paragraph of the instructions here given will be found to
contain something of importance to the student; it is, indeed,
a valuable essay upon a difficult and nice department of
chemical research.</p>

<p>Under the head “Tube Chemistry,” in the sixteenth section,
a variety of means are pointed out, of working with and
employing glass-tubes, as substitutes for more expensive and
formal apparatus. Indeed, the young chemist cannot do
better than practise the art of bending, drawing out, and
sealing tubes, as here directed, (and in the nineteenth section,)
by which he will soon gain the requisite dexterity in forming
them into test tubes, retorts, and so on, and be enabled to
furnish his laboratory with a quantity of very useful vessels
and apparatus, at a very moderate expense.</p>

<p>The application of electricity to chemical purposes forms
the subject of the seventeenth section, in which the
<span class="xxpn" id="p281">[p281]</span>
management of electrical machines and apparatus is described, and
the circumstances necessary to facilitate investigation and
insure success are pointed out. To this succeed the management
and composition of lutes, and a chapter on bending
blowing, and cutting glass.</p>

<p>Cleanliness, order, and regularity are of the utmost importance
in the laboratory; and though the appearance of the
chemist himself is often such that he appears “to doat upon
dirt,” the strictest nicety must generally be observed in the
state of his utensils and apparatus. These matters must,
indeed, generally engage his personal attention; and it is not
sufficient that glasses and other vessels be merely washed and
wiped in the usual way, but they are generally required to
be free from the minutest portions of adhering matter. A
section is accordingly appropriated to the subject of cleanliness
and cleansing, in which, and in that which follows it,
entitled “General Rules for young Experimenters,” much
information is conveyed that will prove useful to those who
are commencing the practice of experimental inquiries in
chemistry, and also to such as, having made some progress,
have indulged themselves in slovenly habits. Macquer’s observations
on this subject, as quoted by our author, are so
much to the purpose, and so well deserving the serious attention
of the young chemist, that we shall stand excused for
inserting them in this place. He says, “A persuasion
must exist that arrangement, order, and cleanliness, are
essentially necessary in a chemical laboratory. Every vessel
and utensil ought to be well cleansed as often it is used,
and put again into its place; labels ought to be attached
to all the substances, mixtures, and products of operations
which are preserved in bottles or otherwise; these should
be examined and cleansed from time to time, and the labels
renewed when required. These cares, although they seem
to be trifling, are, notwithstanding, the most fatiguing
and tedious, but the most important, and often the least observed.
When a person is keenly engaged, experiments
succeed each other quickly; some seem nearly to decide the
matter, and others suggest new ideas; he cannot but proceed
to them immediately, and he is led from one to another; he
thinks he shall easily know again the products of his first
experiments, and therefore he does not take time to put them
in order; he prosecutes with eagerness the experiments
which he has last thought of, and in the mean time the vessels
employed, the glasses and bottles filled, so accumulate
that he cannot any longer distinguish them; or at least he is
<span class="xxpn" id="p282">[p282]</span>
uncertain concerning many of his former products. This evil
is increased, if a new series of operations succeed, and occupy
all the laboratory; or if he be obliged to quit the place for
some time, every thing then goes into confusion. Hence it
frequently happens that he loses the fruits of much labour,
and that he must throw away almost all the products of his
experiments.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The only method of avoiding these inconveniences is to employ the
cares and attentions, above mentioned. It is indeed unpleasant
and very difficult continually to stop in the midst of the most
interesting researches, and to employ much valuable time in cleaning
and arranging vessels and attaching labels. These employments are
capable of cooling and retarding the progress of genius, and are
tedious and disgusting; but they are nevertheless necessary. Those
persons whose fortunes enable them to have an assistant operator,
on whose accuracy and intelligence they can depend, avoid many of
these disagreeable circumstances; but they ought nevertheless to
attend to the execution of these things. We cannot depend too much
on ourselves in these matters, however minute, on account of their
consequences. This becomes even indispensable when the experiments
are to be kept secret, at least for a time, which is very common and
often necessary in chemistry.</p>

<p>“When new researches and inquiries are made, the mixtures, results,
and products of all the operations ought to be kept a long time
well ticketed and noted. It frequently happens that at the end of
some time these things present very singular phenomena, which would
never have been suspected. There are many beautiful discoveries
in chemistry which were made in this manner, and certainly a much
greater number which have been lost, because the products have been
thrown away too hastily, or because they could not be recognised
after the changes which happened to them.”</p></div>

<p>The uses of equivalents, and the method of employing Dr.
Wollaston’s scale, form the subject of the twenty-second
section of Mr. Faraday’s book; and of the concluding sections,
the twenty-third contains a quantity of miscellaneous
remarks, and the twenty-fourth is appropriated to “a course
of inductive and instructive practices;” that is, to a selection
of minute instructions respecting the use of instruments, and
the performance of operations.</p>

<p>Such is an outline of the contents of this volume, of which
we have felt ourselves obliged to speak in terms unequivocally
<span class="xxpn" id="p283">[p283]</span>
favourable; in fact, it contains, strictly speaking, nothing to
criticise. It is minute, laborious, and very unpretending,
and contains a body of instructions for the performance of
experiments, and of descriptions of the modes of managing
and applying apparatus, which is not to be had elsewhere,
being manifestly derived from diligent research, extensive
experience, and correct judgment. It is not a book for
amateurs; for they will presently learn from it that there is
no royal road to the science of which it treats; but the real
student, who will seriously follow its laborious details, will
discover in them an acceptable and sure guide through the
crooked and intricate, as well as the straight paths of chemistry.
Those, however, and those only, who are well versed
in the business of the laboratory, both as experimentalists
and teachers, can duly appreciate the weighty service which
Mr. Faraday has here performed.</p>

population returns of the <em class="italic">decennial lustrum</em>, or period of
ten years, which ended in 1821, were delayed for a considerable
time, on account of the difficulties which have always occurred
in taking the population of Ireland. They have now, however,
been some time completed, and from the <em class="italic">data</em> they afford, a
few reflections naturally present themselves, which though
sufficiently obvious, yet, from the extreme interest of the subject,
may be thought deserving of being brought together, and
exhibited in a connected form. They point out some peculiarities
in the situation of this country, which distinguish it
from almost every other nation that has yet existed in ancient
or modern times.</p>

<p>From the notices which have been published respecting the
different districts, it may be inferred, that the portion which
may be termed the <em class="italic">Urban</em> population, has augmented in a
much greater degree than the <em class="italic">Rural</em>. The general ratio of
increase has, however, been very great, and, in the opinion of
Mr. Malthus, still continues at the same rate. That eminent
<span class="xxpn" id="p284">[p284]</span>
economist has lately given it as his opinion, before the Emigration
Committee, that the present inhabitants of the British
Islands do not amount to less than twenty-two millions and a
half. This estimate is perhaps a little exaggerated; but as
it may be assumed sufficiently near the truth for all the objects
of general speculation, I shall proceed to point out a few of
those leading peculiarities, to which I have just alluded. In
the first place we may assert, I apprehend, on sufficient
grounds, that Great Britain is the most populous nation which
has existed since the Christian era. No other instance has
occurred in which an extent of continuous surface of 93,000
square miles has sustained a population of twenty-two millions.
Italy, which is not of much greater extent, has sometimes
been rated at nearly the same amount, but this estimate has
been formed in the absence of all actual enumeration and is
now ascertained to be a considerable exaggeration. No other
part of the world can enter into the competition, unless it be
certain districts of China and Japan, but which, as our knowledge
of them in this respect is quite uncertain, I shall leave
wholly out of the question. How far some nations of the
ancient world may have approached or gone beyond us in the
race of population, is perhaps equally lost in uncertainty.
There is reason to believe, as I have endeavoured to demonstrate
on another occasion, that some districts of the old world
exceeded, in this respect, any country of modern ages. Amongst
them, perhaps, may be reckoned Egypt, Mesopotamia, the lesser
Asia, and some parts of Persia: but certainly, neither in ancient
nor modern times do we find any instance of a single, compact,
distinct empire, exactly defined, identically governed, and
peopled by twenty-two millions of souls on the same extent of
soil; this is undoubtedly a peculiarity the most striking which
can exist among nations.</p>

<p>In the second place, we may, I think, affirm with tolerable
certainty, that no nation ever contained so many large cities.
On this point Great Britain exhibits a splendid superiority.
We have two cities of the first class, London and Dublin; the
one with a population of more than a million, the other with
little less than three hundred thousand. Of cities of the second
class, or those which reach one hundred thousand inhabitants,
<span class="xxpn" id="p285">[p285]</span>
or above that number, we have seven, <em class="italic">viz.</em>, four in England,
Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol; two in Scotland,
Edinburgh and Glasgow; and one in Ireland, the city of Cork.
These seven average considerably more than one hundred
thousand each. We have fourteen towns of the third class,
or those containing from thirty to fifty thousand or upwards of
inhabitants, <em class="italic">viz.</em>, ten in England: Portsmouth, Plymouth,
Norwich, Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Bath, Newcastle,
Coventry, and Hull. Two in Scotland, Paisley and Dundee,
and two in Ireland, Belfast and Limerick. Of towns of the
fourth class, in which are usually reckoned those of from fifteen
to thirty thousand inhabitants, we have at least thirty, and probably
more. A slight glance at the principal nations of Europe,
with this view, will show at once their immense inferiority.</p>

<p>To begin with France, the most populous of the great sovereignties.
That empire possesses only one city of the first
class, <em class="italic">viz.</em> Paris, which is inferior to London by one third. She
has five of the second class, <em class="italic">viz.</em>, Lyons, Bourdeaux, Marseilles,
Lisle and Rouen; but, according to the latest information which
I have been able to obtain, they will not reach, by a very considerable
proportion, the average number of the seven English
cities of the same class. France has also eight towns of the
third class, <em class="italic">viz.</em>, Amiens, Caen, Nantes, Brest, Toulouse,
Toulon, Mentz, and Versailles. I am not quite sure, as no
census has lately been taken, whether two or three of the following
towns ought not to be included in this class, though I am
inclined, on the whole, to a contrary opinion, <em class="italic">viz.</em>, Melun,
Montpelier, Nanci, Dijon, Tours, Rennes, and Troyes; they
will not, however, I am persuaded, come near the average of
the British third-rate towns. The same remark will hold as
to the number and size of the inferior towns.</p>

<p>With respect to the rest in rank of the great monarchies,
the Austrian Empire, a very few words will suffice, as it cannot
pretend to come into any competition with us, on the point
in question. Austria possesses only one city of the first class,
and three of the second, <em class="italic">viz.</em>, Vienna, Prague, Milan, Venice.
The towns of the third rank are proportionably few. With
Spain, Russia, and Prussia, it would be idle to enter into any
comparison.
<span class="xxpn" id="p286">[p286]</span></p>

<p>It must be confessed, however, that the present kingdom
of the Netherlands, as established by the congress of Vienna
contains, in proportion to its extent and population, more
large towns than any single state which now exists, or perhaps
has ever existed. With an extent of territory and number of
inhabitants scarcely exceeding, one-fourth of the British dominions,
that kingdom has one city the first class, Amsterdam;
two of the second rank, Rotterdam and Brussels; and probably
as many of the third class as Great Britain herself. But the
Kingdom of the Netherlands is in itself too insignificant to
enter into any competition with such a state as Great Britain
for any objects of general comparison. The various states
comprehended under the common geographical appellation of
Italy, if that superb country was united under one head, is the
only one of the European nations which, under the view we
are now considering, could sustain any parallel with Great
Britain. But this union, so desirable in many points of view,
would probably diminish its pretensions as a nation of large
cities. Many of these have reached their present grandeur
and extent by having been long the seat of a court or a government,
and would perhaps decline considerably if reduced to
the rank of mean provincial capitals. But even under any
circumstances of territorial union, Italy could not be held to
comprize more than one city of the first class, <em class="italic">viz.</em>, Naples,
and six of the second, <em class="italic">viz.</em>, Turin, Milan, Venice, Genoa, Florence,
and Rome; whereas, as we have just seen, Britain has
two of the first and seven of the second, and these superior in
size and number of inhabitants.</p>

<p>The third peculiarity which I have to remark in the actual
situation of the British dominions is, that no nation ever had
so great an <em class="italic">urban</em> population, or so large a proportion of its
inhabitants residing in towns. This peculiarity is intimately
connected with that which I have just described; but it is
nevertheless a very different characteristic. Great Britain is
not only distinguished for the number and size of her large
cities, but for having so <em class="italic">great</em> a number of them on so <em class="italic">small</em>
a territory. By the census of 1811, it was found that nearly
half our population resided in towns, and at present, I apprehend,
the proportion will be found still greater. In this
<span class="xxpn" id="p287">[p287]</span>
respect no nation has ever approached us. The French economists
were of opinion that not more than one-fourth of the
people of France lived in towns; and the later statists, who have
alluded to the subject, contend that a still greater proportion of
the population is rural. This will not appear exaggerated when
it is recollected that all the lower classes of that country subsist
principally on vegetable food, and that, consequently, the greater
part of the soil being under tillage, a great number of hands is
required for its cultivation. In Great Britain, on the other
hand, the inhabitants of all classes consume a great quantity
of animal food, and, of course, a great part of our lands, being
in a pastoral state, require a small proportion of occupants.
In the kingdom of the Netherlands, it is supposed about one-third
of the inhabitants live in towns: in Italy about one-fifth:
in Austria, Spain, and Russia, except the province of Siberia,
where the abundance of manufactures congregates the people
in masses, not more than one-fifth. In Russia, Sweden, and
Norway, where, amongst the lower classes, nearly every family
is its own manufacturer, not more than one-eighth or one-ninth.</p>

<p>The fourth and last of these peculiar characteristics which
I shall remark, is, that no great nation ever employed so large
a proportion of its people in trade and manufactures. In
speaking thus, I leave out of the question the Italian and
Flemish republics of the middle ages, and the Hanse Towns,
free cities, and United Provinces of later times. I speak only
of great and extensive countries. It will appear, I doubt not,
by the present census, that at least half our whole population is
employed in trade, commerce, or manufactures. This is a
feature altogether singular; a circumstance to which no parallel
can be found in the ancient or modern world.</p>

<p>From these premises, a few observations, in the way of
corollaries, will naturally suggest themselves.</p>

<p>In the first place, such a state of things is indicative of
great wealth and power. A country thus situated is, beyond
any other, powerful for attack and strong for defence. A profusion
of great cities can only be produced by extensive trade,
and can only be maintained by a highly cultivated soil. The
wealth acquired by the industry of the towns, reacts on the
<span class="xxpn" id="p288">[p288]</span>
industry of the agriculturist, and it is in this that the real
advantages of commerce primarily consist. In this way an
extensive population is gradually generated, for no maxim or
political economy is now more generally admitted, than that
population is sure to follow close and to press hard against the
means of subsistence. An affluence of inhabitants on a comparatively
small territory, is, itself the primary ingredient of
power, and this first requisite of strength is, in the case of
Great Britain, essentially corroborated by our insular situation.
Surrounded by dangerous coasts and tempestuous seas, we can
only be approached at certain points and certain times; whilst,
on the other hand, as this state of things supposes and supports
a powerful navy, we are able in a great degree to choose
our point of attack.</p>

<p>From a population such as we have described, of which only
a very limited part is employed in creating the means of actual
subsistence, a very considerable portion may always be abstracted
for purposes of attack or defence. It is usually calculated,
that one-fifth part of the inhabitants of every country
is capable of bearing arms. On this calculation, Great Britain
contains four millions of fighting men, of whom it is believed
one million might be formed into an army without any very
serious interruption to the essential operations of agriculture
and commerce. This supposition may seem a little extravagant,
but it must be recollected that, at one period during the
late war, the number of men under arms was actually calculated
at seven hundred and fifty thousand.</p>

<p>In the second place, such a state of things is favourable to
public liberty. The congregation of men in great masses is
found to give great force to the influence of public opinion;
by the spirit of discussion which it generates; by the anxiety
for intelligence which it diffuses; by the collisions of opinion
which it engenders, and by the facility of union which it
affords. Nations purely or principally agricultural are generally
under a despotic government, especially large states, for
the maxim of <em class="italic">divide et impera</em> is applicable as well to internal
as to external politics. Ancient Persia and Assyria, and
modern Russia and Poland, are instances in point. The fierce
and demoralizing tyranny of the feudal system, which, after
<span class="xxpn" id="p289">[p289]</span>
the destruction of the Roman monarchy, left scarcely any
other division of the people than those of tyrant and vassal,
could only be effectually broken by the rise of great towns.
These communities were alone competent to resist the aristocratical
and subordinate despotisms into which all the nations
of Europe were subdivided, and which, as is well known,
overawed the throne, whilst they enslaved the people. In
confirmation of this, it may be remarked, that the free republics
of antiquity, as well as those of the middle ages, derived the
spirit which nurtured them almost entirely from the capital
city; and though, in the former case, there was scarcely any
commerce to excite the activity of the people, yet the mere
congregation of a numerous body of men sustained the power
of public opinion.</p>

<p>But the most important question remains behind. Is a
civil community thus constituted favourable to individual virtue
and happiness? This is assuredly the point which it most
behoves us to ascertain, since no truism is more obvious than
that power and opulence, and refinement and splendour, and
even liberty itself, are only so far valuable as they tend to make
men wiser, and better, and happier. Is it true, then, that
Great Britain has anteceded other nations in these fundamental
points, as much as in those we have just described? This question
cannot be answered without some hesitation: for we may
say, with Addison’s facetious Knight, “that a great deal may
be urged on both sides.” On the one hand it is certain that
our situation is eminently favourable to intellectual improvement.
The increasing spread of instruction, and the rapid
advancement of knowledge which are necessarily concurrent
with our career of prosperity, must ultimately advance us in
the scale of moral and rational agents. If knowledge be power,
it is also happiness; for communities as well as individuals
would all be happy if they knew how to be so. It is also
certain that the incessant struggles of competition and the
strenuous efforts for distinction which are always at work in
an over-peopled and highly refined country are favourable to
the active virtues. They operate amongst the higher classes
to provide many objects of laudable ambition; and amongst the
lower, afford perpetual facilities for bettering their condition,
<span class="xxpn" id="p290">[p290]</span>
and furnish an incessant supply of occupation, the want of
which is sure to open the door to the incursion of all the
worst propensities and basest vices. They bring into action
all the resources of human ingenuity; all the aids of fortitude
and enterprise; all the trials of patience and perseverance; all
the equanimity demanded by the constant mutations and rotations
of fortune. It is not to be denied, moreover, that the first-rate
virtues of beneficence, charity, and hospitality, take root
and flourish with peculiar vigour in a commercial community.
The fluctuations of condition to which almost every man
knows himself liable, and the constant proximity of distress
and opulence, offer perpetual excitements to the benevolent
affections.</p>

<p>These, it must be confessed, are important ingredients in the
composition of human happiness; but considerations not less
momentous present themselves on the opposite side, for every
thing in human affairs is on a system of compensations. It is
not to be denied that a state of society, in which one-half of the
population is congregated in towns, and nearly a moiety of this
half crowded together in enormous factories, is highly unpropitious
to virtue, to health, and to happiness. In these huge
receptacles of human labour, it would be absurd to expect that
the women should be distinguished for their modesty and propriety,
or the men for their prudence, temperance, and regularity.
It is an unhappy law of human nature, that the force of
example is most prevalent on the side of vice. A few depraved
characters scattered amongst a multitude are commonly found
sufficient to corrupt the whole mass: hence we may always
expect to find, in the seat of a great manufactory, all the
worst ingredients of civilized society; all the base depravities
of a luxurious and opulent community, combined with much
of the grossness and rudeness of the savage state: in a word,
all the corruptions of high civilization without any of its polish.
Nor is this mode of life, generally speaking, more favourable
to health and comfort than to good morals. The constitution
of the young is impaired, and their growth retarded by excessive
labour and close confinement. Those of maturer age
are glad to seek relief from the depressing effects of a wearisome
and monotonous labour, unwholesome air, and constant
<span class="xxpn" id="p291">[p291]</span>
restraint, in intemperate indulgence; and all the long train of
vices and miseries to which the poor are liable, follows of
course. Nor are their prospects for the future often such as
to encourage hope or stimulate exertion. The habitual improvidence
of the poor is aggravated in their case by the dangerous
fluctuation of their trade. Sometimes they are eagerly
courted with high wages, and lavish promises; at others, no
employment is to be had, and not enough can be earned, even
by the most unnatural exertions, to sustain their families.
Nothing can be imagined more fatal to order, regularity, and
comfort, than these vicissitudes. Hence it commonly happens,
that, in the decline of life, these poor creatures are driven to
the sad resource of parish relief. It is moreover not one of
the least evils of the manufacturing system, that it has a tendency,
in prosperous times, to generate an excessive population,
which, on any great reverse, is suddenly thrown on the
community as a superfluous burden. The changes of a fashion,
the caprice of public taste, or the sudden interruption of a
foreign market, will reduce thousands to helpless and unexpected
poverty.</p>

<p>It must, however, be admitted, that the picture of rural life
has also its unfavourable aspect. Those who retire into the
country are apt to find themselves somewhat disappointed in
their expectations of rustic simplicity and pastoral innocence.
In situations where every breath of air, and every feature of
nature express nothing but peace and love, they are a little
surprised to see the selfish and malignant passions at work in
all their baneful activity; to find, as in the purlieus of a court,
the symptoms of “envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness.”
Still we shall find that instances of utter depravity and
abandoned profligacy are of much rarer occurrence than in
great towns. In a village, every individual is known, and the
very consciousness of being conspicuous, creates a sense of
shame which is highly salutary. It has often been observed,
that men in a body will commit, and even justify, atrocities
which no individual amongst them would be capable of attempting,
if not screened by the shelter of a crowd. We find,
accordingly, in the annals of Wesley and Whitfield, that the
great scenes of their operations are in collieries, factories,
<span class="xxpn" id="p292">[p292]</span>
mines, canals, and all the other appendages of a great commercial
and manufacturing nation. It was there, according
to Whitfield, that the “Arch Enemy” raised his triumphant
standard; it was there, that the harvest of lost souls was ripe
and abundant. But the most decisive proof of the comparative
purity of the rural population above that of the manufacturing
districts, is the fact that the single town of Manchester
will furnish ten times more criminal prosecutions than two
Welch counties which contain an equal number of inhabitants.</p>

<p>On the whole, I think we cannot escape the conclusion,
that, though a certain degree of commercial and manufacturing
property is necessary to stimulate the agriculture of a nation,
and to call forth its utmost powers of production, yet that it
is not desirable that this country should proceed much further
in that dangerous career, or increase still further the disproportion
between its urban and rural population. The late increase
in our numbers is so rapid and alarming, that I am afraid some
positive checks (to use Mr. Malthus’s language) of very terrible
potency must soon be brought into action. The forcible
lines of Goldsmith, though that great poet knew little enough
of political economy, are applicable to the wise and benovolent
statesmen of all
<span class="nowrap">times—</span></p>

<h3><em class="italic">On the Modern Ornaments
of Architecture, &#38;c.</em> <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">I<span>N</span></span>
no age since the Augustan era of Rome, perhaps, has
decoration of the interior of dwellings been carried to greater
excess than at present; nor, since the days of the florid style of
Gothic architecture, has the exterior received more embellishment.
Architectural ornaments have generally been copied
from the antique, those especially which belong to the orders.
Indeed there is a kind of classical standard, which governs
the architect in the execution of public edifices, from which
he cannot with propriety depart. National, and regal emblems,
wherever suitable, should always be introduced in
public buildings, and in those of a private or mixed character
<span class="xxpn" id="p293">[p293]</span>
all legitimate ornaments may be displayed. Of this class
the acanthus, vignette, the branches of the olive, and leaves of
the palm, the crown of laurel, the chaplet of myrtle, and the
wreath of roses, are all proper when judiciously introduced;
and the rose and honeysuckle flowers, and the folicles, trefoils,
cinquefoils, &#38;c., which so often occur on sculpture and
plaster work, are also proper, because they are imitations
of nature.</p>

<p>But in our present style of decorative execution, from the
most elaborate finishing of a regal palace, down to the pattern
of a milk-maid’s gown, there is such latitude taken in the
display of licentious fancy, that imagination itself is baffled
to find anything in the infinite variety of nature’s works, to
which their designs can be compared, or to which they bear
the most distant resemblance!</p>

<p>It is really unaccountable, that the whole tribe of our
artists, the ornamental statuary, scagliolist, paper-stainer,
weaver, chintz and cotton printer, &#38;c. should all be “straining
their low thought to form unreal” forms and figures;
and striking out the most intricate and complicated,
to the utter neglect (except in very few instances) of those
numberless simple though transcendently beautiful configurations,
which everywhere appear in the works of nature.</p>

<p>This is surely a dereliction of all propriety, an exuberance
of grovelling taste which no consideration can excuse, nor
reason justify. In this age of refinement, good taste should
be the guide in all things where invention is
necessary, and design requisite; whatever is grotesque or
fantastic, should be banished from our labours of art, and
the elegant forms of vegetable or animal nature alone take
their place.</p>

<p>If it be asked, how it happens that such obliquity of fancy
(for it cannot be called taste) should so generally prevail, the
answer is, were these pattern-mongers to copy from nature
every body could judge of their ability as imitators, and, if
unfaithful, would decry the artist; whereas, whilst bringing
forth his nondescript and nondescribable forms of imaginary
figures, he escapes the lash of the critic, which otherwise he
would be subjected to.
<span class="xxpn" id="p294">[p294]</span></p>

<p>It may be granted, that it is as ridiculous to form stone or
plaster flowers, as those geometrical frets and fanciful nothings
which are usually pourtrayed in architectural decoration:
but it may be answered that if any ornament be necessary,
that of a nondescript character is not more appropriate, as
such, than natural forms would be; and these latter having
a name, and many of them an emblematical character, may
be often applied with a propriety which cannot belong to the
other.</p>

<p>The old fashioned tapestry, notwithstanding its sombre
appearance, was in its plan much more rational than the
multifigurations of our modern paper hangings. The first
represented some historical event or legendary tale, yielding
some mental information, or it taught perhaps a moral lesson—the
eye was amused while tracing the ideas of the ingenious
sempstress; but in our ephemeral and gaudy ten-thousand-times
repeated <em class="italic">paper</em> nothings, there is no design to interest,
nor combination to amuse the eye longer than a transient
glance. Even the Chinese, who, in all their decorative finishings
shew <em class="italic">rigidity</em> itself, have escaped from tame mannerism
in paper hangings, by imitating, from the edge of the carpet
to the ceiling, all the gradations of turf, herbs, shrubs, and
trees, upon a sky ground, enriched with figures or rather
portraits of flowers and fruit, as well as beasts, birds and insects.
This though it cannot deceive the spectator for one
moment in mistaking a fictitious for a real scene, yet is
certainly far superior to European paper-upholstery, as it at
least may introduce a knowledge of natural history, which the
latter has no pretension to, indeed seems studiously to discard,
as beneath imitation.</p>

<p>All this vitiated taste, or fashion rather, is to be regretted;
especially as it appears that those</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p>Fancied forms which on the ceilings sprawl,</p>
<p>And shapeless frets which decorate the wall,</p>
</div></div>

<p class="continue">are just as expensive, and difficult of execution, as the most
elegant imitation of vegetable or animal configuration would
be; and surely when such variety of forms are presented to the
artist, they deserve to be copied as transcendently superior to
the capricious fancies of the most celebrated decorator, or of
<span class="xxpn" id="p295">[p295]</span>
the most splendid fashionable designs; either in the works of
the sculptor, scagliolist, &#38;c. or the more insignificant designers
of figured paper or drapery. Indeed there can be no good
reason why ox-heads and garlands (now the days of sacrifices
are past) should not be banished from the frieze and entablature,
to admit the far more appropriate figures of foliage, fruit,
and flowers, aquatic as well as terrestrial, which every garden
yields;—and for interior enrichments of cornices, mouldings,
&#38;c., the curious and elegant forms of the testacea, would
afford beautiful copies for imitation.</p>

<p>In fine, if there be any merit or propriety in the adaptation
of whatever is elegant in form, beautiful in outline, harmonious
in tint and proportion, and congruous in combination, such
may readily be found in the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
Faithful representations of such objects, not only open a
fine field for the exercise of individual ability, at this time, but
also a source from which might be drawn a large share of
public patronage, and consequent commensurate reward.
Indeed it is now pretty evident that in many things, especially
in the minor works of art, we have been too long and too
rigidly impressed with a veneration for the works of antiquity,
or what is equally benumbing, a passive following of tyrant
fashion; and that many a bright genius has been “nipped in
the bud,” and remained “twinkling in the socket” of Grecian
and Roman rules, who, if venturous enough to have burst the
shackles of professional thraldom, would have improved and
elevated his art, as well as himself, by designs and works
which would have advanced his profession and adorned his
country.</p>

<p>But it is not yet too late; a knowledge and study of the
genuine elements of taste, whether of art or nature, and a mind
embued with rational perceptions of all that is beautiful
and picturesque, and grand or sublime in either, will rise
superior to all precedential fetters, as well as all modern mannerism,
and will equally regard the excellencies of the ancients,
as it will avoid the errors of some modern artists, who, in
leaving the beaten track, have deviated far and widely from
the point to which good sense and good taste would have
led.
<span class="xxpn" id="p296">[p296]</span></p>

<p>A list of plants, &#38;c. which exemplify all that is elegant in
form, beautiful in outline and graceful in position, should
have accompanied the above imperfect remarks, but this must
be deferred to another opportunity.</p>

<h3><em class="italic">De l’Influence des Agens Physiques sur la Vie. Par</em> W. F.
Edwards, D. M., &#38;c. <a href="#jpart2">◊</a>
<span class="smaller">
[Continued from the last Number.]</span></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">I<span>N</span></span>
our last number we presented our readers with a general
abstract of the first part of this valuable work. The second
part refers to animals of the <em class="italic">cold blood</em> order, including <em class="italic">fish</em>
and <em class="italic">reptiles</em>. The <em class="italic">larvæ</em> of the latter underwent some comparative
experiments detailed in the first chapter, because
they partake of the nature both of <em class="italic">fish</em> and <em class="italic">reptiles</em>, as to
their <em class="italic">respiratory function</em>; the imperfection of their intermediate
state and developement of organization not interfering
with the objects in view, and the double mode of
aërification being exercised unequally. The <em class="italic">skin</em> of these
young animals furnishes them with the means of producing
the requisite changes in the blood by <em class="italic">absorption</em>, as in the
adult, while it lives in water; and the cutaneous respiration
goes on through this medium at a temperature which the
subsequent more perfect animal is unable to endure. The
object entertained is the influence of physical agents upon
the changes which these animals pass through in their form
and structure.</p>

<p>An important condition of their advancement to maturity
seems to be, that the nutriment suspended in the water
should be in very small and limited proportions. Temperature
also influences their constitutional changes.</p>

<p>Sometimes the <em class="italic">larvæ</em> pass through the winter in their
primitive state; a fact not generally known. Some <em class="italic">tadpoles</em>
were confined within wooden boxes submersed in the river
Seine, in which holes were perforated to allow the stream to
pass through, without the possibility of the animals rising to
the surface of the water, and thus to inhale air. Others
were placed in a large vessel of Seine water renewed at
intervals, with power to rise above the surface. Ten in
twelve of the first box underwent no transformation, the
others having gone partially through their change. But
<span class="xxpn" id="p297">[p297]</span>
those of the large vessel, and not submersed in the river,
passed through their changes of form without the least
appearance of the phenomenon being retarded. The running
waters of the Seine probably contained nutritious
matter, which the water periodically renewed was more
deficient in.</p>

<p>Under circumstances of moderate nourishment and temperature,
the tadpoles under water did not complete their
changes but in a very partial and protracted manner, while
the greater portion made no change. The great difference
in the circumstances of the experiments seems to have been
the access to the air of those which went through their
transformations as usual. Exclusion from light made no
difference in the results, and these were solely influenced
by occasional renewal of air from pulmonary respiration.</p>

<p>These animals possessing a double respiration, cutaneous
and pulmonic, that is, absorbing air from the water around
them and inhaling it from the atmosphere on its surface,
renders these facts highly curious. Fish possess only the
means of aquatic respiration, and the influence of temperature
was tried upon them submersed in water deprived of its air
by previous boiling, the heat being varied from 0° to 40°.
The fish died quicker under these circumstances than the
frog species in the same situation; but their lives were prolonged
more in the <em class="italic">descent</em> of the thermometer than during
its <em class="italic">elevation</em>, as also occurred with the experiments on frogs
and salamanders; and, in both cases, the younger the animal,
the less it could resist the higher temperatures. At
40° the young animals only survived about two minutes, and
the adults many more.</p>

<p>Fish were also submersed in closed vessels of aërated
water, and, by varying the temperature and the quantities
of water, the duration of their lives was augmented in proportion
to the increased volume of the liquid, the temperature
remaining the same; but when these experiments were
conducted in open vessels, the contact with the atmosphere
altered the phenomena. At 20°, a small fish expired in four
hours; and when the temperature was lowered to 10° or 12°,
the same sort of animal lived several days; and when the
water was kept clean by being changed every twenty-four
hours, the fish lived indefinitely.</p>

<p>It is known that fish rise periodically to the surface of the
waters to respire; and Dr. Edwards discovered that they
did so when they have reduced the properties of the air
<span class="xxpn" id="p298">[p298]</span>
dissolved in the water to a lower standard than is requisite for
the proper aërification of their blood; thus renewing their
supply of <em class="italic">oxygen</em>.</p>

<p>The functions of this class of animals have always been
obscure; and their phenomena are different from those of
others. Different species of fish die at various periods when
deprived of water, some in a few minutes, others in a few
hours; and it appears that their dissolution arises not so
much from incapability of atmospheric respiration (for the
experiments of Sylvester prove that they can respire pure
air), as from the different state of the air.</p>

<p>Some experiments on <em class="italic">lizards</em>, <em class="italic">snakes</em>, and <em class="italic">turtles</em> conclude
the researches among cold-blooded animals. The skins of
these, like those of the frogs and salamanders, received
vivifying influence from the air, mainly acting, in conjunction
with pulmonary respiration, to promote their existence.
<em class="italic">Snakes</em> and <em class="italic">turtle</em>, their pulmonary respiration being insulated,
from their skins being guarded from atmospheric
influence, were found alive; but the <em class="italic">lizards</em> died in a few
hours, when the vivifying contact of the air was removed
from their bodies, and they breathed only by their mouths.
Animals naturally defended by <em class="italic">scales</em> transpire much less
than such as have their skins free. Thus <em class="italic">frogs</em>, <em class="italic">toads</em>, and
<em class="italic">salamanders</em> yielded more by perspiration than <em class="italic">lizards</em>,
<em class="italic">snakes</em>, and <em class="italic">turtle</em>, in a given time; and the porosity of the
skin of course regulates the facility of transpiration in all
cases.</p>

<p>With these experiments and remarks, Dr. Edwards concludes
the second part of his researches. The third part
includes <em class="italic">animals of warm blood</em>, in which will be found
some curious and interesting remarks on the heat of young
animals compared with that of adults.</p>

<p>Dr. Edwards refutes the common notion of young animals
being necessarily hotter than adults. The heat of young
puppies was very near that of the parent, or one or two
degrees less, but this variation was not constant. Some
new-born kittens and rabbits were also subjected to similar
trials, and the results led to a conclusion that the temperature
of young animals is <em class="italic">less</em> than that of adults.</p>

<p>According to these experiments, the power of resisting the
cooling influence of the air acquires force as the animal
grows up; and those examples related, in which artificial
covering was adopted, show that nudity is not the only cause
of the reduction of heat, which is, in fact, more referrible
<span class="xxpn" id="p299">[p299]</span>
to their infantile constitution. At first the sucking animal
shows little variation from the parent temperature; then
this becomes more and more reduced, and about the fifteenth
day it is a degree or two below the mother.</p>

<p>Birds, which are warmer than mammiferæ, were next
made the objects of experimental inquiry, and the young
recently hatched exhibited a <em class="italic">lower</em> temperature than the
grown birds. After removal from the shelter of their nests
into a mild atmosphere of 17°, in one hour they cooled down
from 36° to 19°, thus losing 17° in an hour. At an elevation
of 22° the same results were obtained, and they cooled down
to within one degree of the surrounding air. The plumage
of birds has little if any influence upon their temperature.
The production of heat lies within, and not on the surface
of the animal; and if it be strongly developed, the removal
of natural coverings does not influence the heat produced;
and if it be weak, their addition will not prevent cooling.
Birds recently escaped from the shell cooled to within two
degrees of the air, whereas the unplumed adult birds scarcely
lost one degree.</p>

<p>The distinctive character of warm-blooded animals to preserve
an uniformity of heat has no reference to <em class="italic">bulk</em>. The
<em class="italic">eagle</em> maintains the same temperature as the <em class="italic">wren</em> or the
<em class="italic">tom-tit</em>, taking them at the same age, and placing them
under the same circumstances; but if cooling measures be
adopted, the lesser body parts with its heat faster than the
larger, though ultimately they arrive at the same point.
The dimensions of animals are infinitely varied; but the giant
reaches no higher standard than the dwarf, nor sinks to a
lower temperature.</p>

<p>In estimating the temperature of young animals, it must
be taken into account that they are born at different periods
of organic developement. Some come earlier into the world
than others, and some are more perfectly formed than others
at their birth, and more capable of helping themselves.
This variation produces a different standard of heat after
birth, and especially creates a variety of temperature among
birds when tested at the same epochs of their existence.
The season in which animals are produced also modifies their
temperature.</p>

<p>The influence of age in modifying temperature is common
both to mammiferæ and birds. Young and healthy sucking
pigs cooled faster than their parent, their generating means
of heat being more feeble. Animals of warm blood possess
<span class="xxpn" id="p300">[p300]</span>
the power of supplying heat at its <em class="italic">maximum</em> when first born;
they then part with it by degrees, and, as they advance in
age, their heat becomes gradually augmented again till it
reaches the adult standard.</p>

<p>Dr. Edwards next proceeds to discuss the phenomena of
animal temperature more exclusively regarding adults, and
especially among those singular creatures of the mammiferæ
which form an exception to the general law of nature
respecting the uniformity of temperature as to warm-blooded
animals. These beings are what are termed <em class="italic">hybernants</em>,
such as the <em class="italic">dormouse</em>, the <em class="italic">hedgehog</em>, the <em class="italic">bat</em>, the <em class="italic">marmot</em>,
&#38;c., natives of Europe; which remain dormant during winter
without any external signs of life and motion. The change
which these undergo reduces them from the state of warm-blooded
animals to that of cold. Unlike the rest of their
class, the autumnal season lowers their temperature by degrees,
till in winter it reaches so low as to be scarcely higher
than the surrounding air. Their powers fail gradually, and
their losses of heat are not repaired, till at length their
respirations become slow and feeble, and the heart languidly
urges the blood through the arteries. In this state there is
an imperfect aërification of the blood, and a partial state
of asphyxia, producing continued repose of the nervous and
muscular system. But the temperature of these animals
sinks no lower than the air, and remains sufficient to maintain
a passive existence, till the returning spring raises their
heat again, and they become lively and active till autumn;
but even in spring these animals are characterised by producing
less heat than others of their class.</p>

<p>If we seek to know the cause of this curious variety, we
can only refer it to peculiarity of constitution, which is instituted
by nature as adapted to animals placed in situations
of rigorous cold, and where they cannot procure sustenance
but in spring and summer.</p>

<p>Our author imitated the process of hybernation by artificial
cold, and produced the same effects; and when he
restored animation by gradual warmth, he found the animals
as lively as before.</p>

<p>John Hunter and others have written on the natural history
of hybernants, and Dr. Edwards regards only their
temperature. The experiments on hybernants by artificial
cold prove this fact, that hybernation is attributable to other
causes than to the reduction and deprivation of nutriment;
for the animals submitted to the ordeal of cold were well
<span class="xxpn" id="p301">[p301]</span>
fed, and in the lively season of advanced spring. The deprivation
of food seems to be a local consequence provided
for by the phenomenon of hybernation, and not its exciting
cause. Nor does there appear to be any change of organization
in these cases, but a state of constitution exists which
we are unable to account for further.</p>

<p>We have, in the next place, a series of experiments showing
the influence of the <em class="italic">seasons</em> upon animal temperature with
the warm-blooded; by which it seems that they produce a
variety of results: and it is demonstrated that animals of
warm blood in general undergo some constitutional changes
with the periodical returns of the seasons. When, for example,
the highest degree of temperature is attained, animals
no longer produce heat; so that their temperature continues
below that of the air in the hot season. And, in the cold
season, if the cold be not too rigorous, the animal’s age offers
a proportionate resistance to the cooling effects of the air
as the approach to maturity is attained. An elevated and
a depressed temperature thus produce contrary effects upon
the internal powers of generating animal heat, a high temperature
arresting them, and a low one promoting them.
<em class="italic">Thus we cannot fail to observe the beautiful adaptation of
means to final causes</em>.</p>

<p>Upon the subject of <em class="italic">asphyxia</em> in warm-blooded animals,
Dr. Edwards found a great dependence between animal heat
and the faculty of living without contact with the air, a state
in which the blood is not aërated by respiration, and which
is sustained by hybernants while in the dormant condition.
Having submersed animals in water of various temperatures
successively, so as to bring them under the influence of variable
temperature, he found the <em class="italic">descending</em> scale of temperature
the most hurtful. The <em class="italic">ascending</em> heat was that which
prolonged life most. Between 20° and 10° the results were
similar to those between 20° and 40°.</p>

<p>Animals, then, of warm blood in a state of asphyxia hold
their existence on two principal conditions relative to heat;
one regarding the different measures by which some develope
their heat, and the other the degree of external temperature.
The first is proper to animals naturally, the second
fortuitous.</p>

<p>Upon the <em class="italic">respiration</em> of both young and adult animals the
author arrives at a conclusion opposite to that of common
opinion, which is founded on the notion of the heat in young
animals being higher than that of the matured. Finding,
<span class="xxpn" id="p302">[p302]</span>
however, as already noticed, that the parent exceeds the
temperature of its offspring after birth, it is naturally concluded
that its consumption of air is also greatest. This was
experimentally confirmed, and is in unison with other facts.
In the first part of this work the vertebratæ of cold blood
were also found to consume least air in proportion to their
diminution of temperature. Temperature seems to act
uniformly with all the vertebratæ, and their consumption of
air is in proportion. The <em class="italic">mammiferæ</em> have a lower temperature
than <em class="italic">birds</em>, and they consume less air than the latter.
Fish and reptiles consume less air than the warm-blooded,
and possess a lower temperature.</p>

<p>The influence of the <em class="italic">seasons</em> upon <em class="italic">respiration</em> is considered
in the sixth chapter. Many changes occur in the atmosphere
during the revolutions of the seasons, varieties in the temperature,
and the pressure and density of the air. Dr.
Edwards shows that the faculty of producing heat with
warm-blooded animals is greater in <em class="italic">winter</em> than in <em class="italic">summer</em>,
the constitution of animals being adapted to their individual
climates; and in reference to the relation of this faculty to
the consumption of air, it is presumable, all other circumstances
being alike, that the consumption ought to be
increased with the faculty of developing heat, and the experiments
justify the presumption.</p>

<p>Upon the subject of <em class="italic">transpiration</em>, it is shown that the air
not only exercises a vivifying effect upon the constitution,
but one little less important in removing a vaporous substance
from the surface of the body, and which is separated
from the fluids before its conversion into vapour, and known
by the name of perspiration or sweat, which transpires from
the skin. The variations in the temperature of the air possess
great influence over this function. Experiments on this
subject were detailed most fully in our last Number, relative
to cold-blooded animals; and therefore these need not now
be repeated in respect to the warm-blooded, for the results
are exactly similar, as to transpiration in equal and successive
periods, the comparative influence of dry and moist
states of the air, and the effects of air in motion and in repose.
Inspection of the table annexed to the work displays the
similarity of the effects produced by the same physical agents
upon cold and warm blooded animals, and this accordance
serves to afford mutual support to the different investigations.</p>

<p>We are now arrived at the fourth and last part of this
<span class="xxpn" id="p303">[p303]</span>
work. Much, however, of this part appertains to what has
been already detailed upon other animals. But the modifications
of heat in the human being, from the period of birth
to maturity, will be found highly interesting. They accord
precisely with the results obtained among the lower animals
and mammiferæ; and present analogical proofs of the general
application of principles laid down in the preceding portions
of our notices.</p>

<p>While, however, we trace analogy throughout the animal
kingdom, it must be remembered that there are infinite
sources of variation arising from the extensive variety of
species modifying those principles, which are governed by
a general harmony of effect. Of all animals, man exhibits
this variety the most, possessing, as he does, attributes above
all the groups of his class, from his intellectual properties,
speech, &#38;c., rendering his race unique and superior to all
others. Our curiosity cannot, therefore, be allowed to rest
satisfied with the general application of principles, until we
have observed their modifications in the human being as well
as in brutes. It is highly interesting to inquire into the conditions
of human phenomena, and examine the forces which
man opposes in his intelligent character to the physical
agents around him. He is equally liable to their influence,
exists by their contact, and yields, like other members of the
animal kingdom, to their destructive tendency. The essential
distinctions appertaining to his economy are thus the
more necessary to be understood. His <em class="italic">organization</em> affords
him no shelter from the operations of physical laws beyond
that of brutes; but the superiority of his nature may be
supposed to modify their influence from causes referrible to
his <em class="italic">sensibility</em>. These have formed the subject of Dr.
Edwards’s inquiry.</p>

<p>Man’s state and condition, at his birth, place him in very
different circumstances from those at which he subsequently
arrives. Here, therefore, we see an extensive field of
inquiry; and it is suggested whether, in the infantile state,
man generates <em class="italic">less heat</em> than in more matured existence.
Dr. Edwards has shown that the young of mammiferæ generally,
being born at the period when their eyes are open,
produce <em class="italic">less</em> heat than adults. It is, therefore, presumable
that the generating powers of heat differ in the two states of
existence which man goes through, the infantile and mature.</p>

<p>But the power of producing heat differs among adult
animals, and it is desirable to know the limits of this faculty,
<span class="xxpn" id="p304">[p304]</span>
Moreover, this power differs in different parts of the body;
so that, when experiments are made, we should always apply
the thermometer to the same part of the body. Among
twenty adult persons, Dr. Edwards found the average temperature
36°.12: in infants from a few hours to two days
old, 34°.75 was the average. Thus we perceive that the
temperature of human infants is <em class="italic">inferior</em> to that of adults.
In infants born previous to the usual period, two or three
hours after birth their heat was at 32° of Reaumur’s scale.
So far we perceive a similarity in man to the mammiferæ in
general.</p>

<p>We have next a chapter on the effects of <em class="italic">cold</em> upon mortality
at different ages. It is highly interesting to observe
the care of animals towards their offspring, in protecting
them against the effects of cold instinctively at a period
before their own powers of generating heat enable them to
resist its baneful tendency.</p>

<p>Dr. Edwards endeavours to investigate the subject of cold,
so as to discover its limit of action. He examined the young
of mammiferæ and birds, the former born with closed eyes,
and the latter unfledged. He exposed them separately and
apart to the air, so as to be independent of each other’s
warmth, and they exhibited a temperature below their natural
standard at the period of birth, even when a degree of artificial
heat was applied beyond that of adult birds. The final
result of these experiments was, that the application of heat
may be conducive to their developement, but is not indispensable
to their preservation. The author discovered, that
the diminution of temperature is not equally injurious at all
ages. The <em class="italic">younger</em> the animal, the <em class="italic">less</em> is the injury sustained
by cold, because the faculty of producing heat is less
powerful with the young than with the matured animal, the
power increasing as the animal grows, and also with the
increase of cold.</p>

<p>Still, however, this subject is open to inquiry, for the
great variety of species, and other circumstances belonging to
the animal creation, so modify the phenomena as to create
an almost endless field of investigation. When warm-blooded
animals are exposed by their parents to the atmospheric
influence at an early age, they are better provided
against the perils of cold, being born with an abundant
source of heat. But, if the cold exceeds their powers of
generating heat, the mortality is so much readier. Hence
arises the danger of animals being born in the winter season.
<span class="xxpn" id="p305">[p305]</span>
Two circumstances are distinguishable, the refrigeration of
the body, and the temperature it is capable of sustaining.
The cooling is so much less injurious with the young. If
two young animals of the same species be cooled down
equally, the youngest suffers the least. But, in order to
lower to the same number of degrees the temperature of
bodies of different ages, the external heat should be lowered
in proportion to the advancement of the animal towards
maturity, in order to compensate for the difference which the
modification of age produces.</p>

<p>While it is true that the younger animals suffer least from
cold, it is, at the same time, to be considered that they cool
down more rapidly. On this principle depends the mortality
of our domestic fowls and other animals, the management
of which requires so much observation and experience in
order to rear them. In regions where the temperature is
liable to great alterations in the course of the year, man and
other vertebrated animals of warm blood are liable to suffer
in their health; for, though <em class="italic">cold</em> should produce the resistance
derived from the necessary constitutional developement
of heat, this increase of caloric, having its limits, often exposes
the constitution to the effects of too great reduction
of temperature, as is exemplified in the frozen regions of the
North Pole, in Siberia, and in Russia.</p>

<p>The young of mammiferæ, in general, were found by Dr.
Edwards to differ very materially in the duration of their
lives, in a state of asphyxia, often being limited to from five
to eleven minutes, according to their developement at birth,
the most advanced in organization living the longest period.
The author proved these facts by placing animals in a state
of asphyxia under water; and it is remarkable that, in all
his experiments, the <em class="italic">voluntary</em> motions were always first
destroyed, the <em class="italic">involuntary</em> outliving them. With dogs, cats,
and rabbits, sensibility existed only three or four minutes.
A puppy showed <em class="italic">automatic</em> signs of life nearly half an hour.
The best divers appear to be able to remain under water
from three to four minutes.</p>

<p>When animals are entirely deprived of aërial contact, it
may be inquired, what are the principal functions exercised?
When the air circulates through the lungs, it imparts to
the blood a peculiar quality, by which its colour becomes
changed. Deprived of this influence from the air, the blood
acquires a dark colour, and the <em class="italic">nervous function</em> is
<span class="xxpn" id="p306">[p306]</span>
simultaneously affected. Among <em class="italic">reptiles</em>, Dr. Edwards found
that life could be maintained by this dark blood; but it is
questionable whether the circulation of venous or dark
blood can promote life in animals of the warm-blooded kind.
Temperature certainly modifies their capability of existence.
Under 20°, they live longest; at 0°, their existence is
shortest. The vitality of the nervous system seems to be
thus directly influenced by temperature.</p>

<p>Of all the phenomena of animal life, those relative to the
blood’s state in asphyxia are, perhaps, the most interesting and
curious, from loss of consciousness, sensation, and voluntary
motion attending its disoxygenated state. If, however,
animals differ so materially under the influence of a deprivation
of air, as to the duration of such existence, we may imagine a
corresponding difference relative to their respirations modified
by species, age, &#38;c. Air, the <em class="italic">pabulum vitæ</em>, is not
equally consumed by all, but in different proportions; at
least, such is the presumption from the experiments upon
animals of warm blood. The relative proportions of this
difference are sought to be ascertained. Warm-blooded
animals of equal size and age, at their liveliest period of age,
were the objects of comparative inquiry. We must refer
the reader to the table at the end of the work for the results.
A marked difference is observable between the quantity of
air consumed by the cold-blooded animals and that required
for the support of the warm-blooded; and each has an organization
appropriated to the individual distinctions. Thus
the structure of the reptile and fish entails the lesser consumption
of air, compared with that of the mammiferæ and
birds. Fish consume least air, reptiles stand next, then the
mammiferæ, and, lastly, birds consume most. The two last,
however, very nearly approach each other; so do also the
two first; and the distinction between the organization and
the consumption of air is most strongly marked between the
fish and reptiles on the one hand, and the mammiferæ and
birds on the other, which, indeed, has caused their separation
into two distinct groups, by the appellation of <em class="italic">cold</em> and <em class="italic">warm
blooded animals</em>,—a distinction which clearly separates the
whole of the vertebrated animals into two groups, bearing
different physiological characters in their relations to animal
heat and respiration.</p>

<p>The mere temperature of the blood in each group is insufficient
for our knowledge of their distinctive characters. We
<span class="xxpn" id="p307">[p307]</span>
further find them characterised by a consumption of air in
union with their heat, so as to unite these two functions,
and thus render them dependent upon the same organs.
Dr. Edwards has further shown, that from birth to maturity
the production of heat goes on increasing with the consumption
of air. And thus age (as well as the seasons) has
been shown to be a modifier of animal heat; for, as the hot
season advances, the consumption of air becomes diminished,
and when the cold sets in, it increases; and this decrease and
increase are accompanied by corresponding developements
of heat.</p>

<p>In cases of fainting, of hysteric and asthmatic fits, the
principle here laid down, as to the balance between the air
consumed and heat, is instinctively acted upon by the most
ignorant persons, who open all the doors and windows to
admit cold air, and dash cold water in the patient’s face.
The addition or continuance of heat increases the affection.
The application of cold produces instant relief. The state
of asphyxia is relieved, the senses return, the pulse beats at
the wrist, and the respiration goes on naturally. The <em class="italic">cooling</em>
renders the air, unfit before, fitted for the purposes of life.</p>

<p>The effects of temperature upon the respiratory movements
are indicated also in those constitutional changes
which diminish the production of heat and the consumption
of air. Organic affection of the heart or lungs may produce
this change, which entails the necessity of a change of climate,
or an alteration of temperature artificially, to restore
the balance between the air and the animal heat.</p>

<p>A very elaborate and complete argument, and series of
experiments, are devoted to the subject of <em class="italic">transpiration</em>,
and the effect upon it of the influence derived from repose of
the body and sleep, by the air’s motion or stillness, and by
the pressure of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>We have, however, pursued the interesting points touched
upon so far as to render it impossible to enter at present
upon this portion of the work. The importance of the subject
demands a fuller investigation and report than we have
now room for; and we must, therefore, defer it to another
opportunity.

<h3><em class="italic">Experiments on</em>
<span class="smcaps">T<span>HOUGHT</span></span>. By a Correspondent.
 <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">T<span>HERE</span></span>
is a very common prejudice respecting the rapidity
of thought, which is imagined by many to be almost unlimited:
and the opinion is very worthily illustrated by a reference
to the oriental tale of a man’s being bewitched into the
belief that he had passed through a period of seven years
duration, and full of the most striking vicissitudes; all in the
time that he employed in dipping his head in a pail of water.
Now there is no doubt that we often dream of a period of
many years while we are only sleeping an hour; that is, we
dream of an impression of a long continued existence, or
perhaps of some detached fact scattered through such a
period: but if any person will write down all that he can
possibly recollect, of the separate imaginations that have
passed through his mind in the dream, he will find that he will
be able to read them over with ease in less than five minutes.</p>

<p>It is probable that there may be considerable diversity in
the rapidity of thought in different persons, as there is in that
of muscular motions: but there is no reason to think the
diversity greater. A healthy young man can run a mile in
five minutes: a good pedestrian in four; but no man ever ran
a mile in three minutes; and perhaps no horse in two. There
is reason to think the rapidity of thought does not differ more
materially than this in different individuals.</p>

<p>The rapidity of thought seems, however, more intimately
connected with that of muscular motion than by analogy only:
for they appear in some cases to be absolutely identical.</p>

<p>I have often been able to count ten in a second, in audible
English words; not distinctly, indeed, but so as to assure myself
that I do hear the ten words in their proper order; and to
repeat the sounds for several consecutive seconds. If I say
the words <em class="italic">to myself</em> only, that is, if I think them over, I
cannot repeat them ten times in less than about nine seconds:
I can never, for example, keep pace with my pulse, though it
sometimes beats as slowly as seventy in a minute: nor can
I, by any effort, think over the numbers from one to twenty in
two seconds.</p>

<p>If I say to myself the first lines of Milton or Virgil, or
<span class="xxpn" id="p309">[p309]</span>
Homer, or any other lines that may be still more familiar to
me, I cannot get through them much, if at all, more rapidly
than I can pronounce them, even when I fix my undivided
attention on them.</p>

<p>The rapidity of sensation is also intimately connected with
that of memory and of muscular action. To cast the eye over
a sentence, attending to every letter, is an operation which is
capable of equal rapidity with the saying it over mentally: but
it cannot be made much more rapid. It required four seconds
to look over a sentence which occupied six in rapid reading.</p>

<p>The operations, which succeed each other with this limited
rapidity, are not incompatible with a partial attention to other
subjects: just as in running or walking, we may have our
feelings very strongly interested by the sight of surrounding
objects without interrupting the train of voluntary motions,
which seems thus to be so linked together in a continued
chain, as to become almost involuntary. And we may certainly
be saying a thing over as rapidly as possible to ourselves,
and may at the same time be seeing, and hearing, and
even reasoning, so as to keep up what amounts very nearly,
though not completely, to a continuity of attention to several
distinct trains of ideas: in the same manner as the nerves
of involuntary action are notoriously employed in several distinct
trains of concatenated muscular motions and vascular
actions, and as the ear of a musician is able to follow and
retain a dozen different melodies in harmony with each other
at the same time.</p>

<p>Dr. Darwin mentions an experiment which has a similar
tendency to show the close connexion between thought and
sensation. He says, that if we think intensely of a deep
colour, for instance red, with the eyes closed, we shall see a
tinge when we open them of the opposite colour, or green;
just as if we had actually looked at a red colour instead of
thinking of it. But I confess that I have never been able to
satisfy myself completely of the success of the experiment.</p>

<p>These very hasty observations appear to me to be in great
measure original; and the results of such experiments are
certainly more calculated to illustrate the nature and powers
of the human mind, than the fanciful hypothesis of the fashionable
<span class="xxpn" id="p310">[p310]</span>
craniologists, with all their measurements of the heads of
murderers, are likely to become.</p>

<p class="spctop">
<span class="smcaps">P<span>OSTSCRIPT</span></span>.—I find that some
similar remarks have been
made by the late Sir William Watson, in his Treatise on Time.
He estimated, from some experiments made in company with
his friend Herschel, the greatest possible velocity of sensation,
such as to admit of about three hundred distinct impressions
on the eye or the ear in a second. “It is true,” he observes,
“that whoever attends to what passes in his imagination on
particular occasions, will be struck at the apparent rapidity
with which ideas appear to flow at times, and will be apt to
suspect them far to exceed sensation in that respect. But it
is probable that we are ourselves deceived in such cases.”
P. 38. But there are no direct experiments to prove this
opinion. On the other hand, a sound may be continuous, and
yet consist of only about twenty vibrations, or still fewer, in a
second.</p>

By a Correspondent. <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first">My dear Sir,</p>

<p>You will be glad to hear that I have made some little
progress in study of the Enchorial inscriptions which I had
lately the pleasure of showing you: my steps have, as usual,
been guided by no <em class="italic">system</em> whatever: they have been wholly
<em class="italic">empirical</em>, and though very slow, I trust they are so much the
more sure: and I hope they will at least serve as an excuse
for my reminding you of the expectations you kindly allowed
me to entertain, that you would send me copies of any thing
of the kind that you might find among the objects entrusted to
your care at Turin. What I have lately done has only been
to ascertain the dates of many of the tablets sent by Mr. Salt
<span class="xxpn" id="p311">[p311]</span>
from Sacchara, all of them about the time of the last Cleopatra:
to identify the Enchorial name of Ptolemy
<span class="smcaps">D<span>IONYSUS</span></span>,
and to make out a passage relating to a donation of
<span class="smmaj">MUCH GOLD AND SILVER AND GEMS TO THE SANCTUARY OF
THE GREAT GOD AT</span>
<span class="smcaps">M<span>EMPHIS</span></span>. The different forms of the characters employed
by the writers, in the same words, constitute also a
valuable addition to be means of deciphering any new inscriptions
of a similar nature, and I have already incorporated
many of them with my little Enchorial Dictionary.</p>

<p>The 48th and 49th plates of the Hieroglyphics, already published,
contain two tablets, apparently funerary, but without
any dates of the reigns: the ages of the persons seem to be
expressed in the hieroglyphical lines. In the 49th we find
the name Berenice twice in the Enchorial letters, and once
in hieroglyphics; followed here by Arsinoe, possibly as her
mother.</p>

<p>This tablet, coarse as it is, abundantly shows that Horapollo
and Champollion are both correct, independently, as it
seems, of each other, in considering the rings, or cartouches,
as chiefly confined to the names of royal personages; and that
I inferred the contrary somewhat too hastily, from observing
that the <em class="italic">imitations</em> of those rings were attached in the Enchorial
inscription of Rosetta, to several names not royal, and
from having found such rings in other hieroglyphical inscriptions,
without the usual epithets of kings. I had, indeed,
remarked, that a “mysterious” name was <em class="italic">sometimes</em> observable
in the manuscripts without a ring, and I had pointed out
the same group as <em class="italic">a</em> name in Lord Mountnorris’s manuscript,
which Mr. Champollion considers as the true name: but I
am perfectly ready to admit that Mr. Champollion has materially
<em class="italic">improved</em> on this hint, as he has on many others.</p>

<p>The same line of hieroglyphics, however, contributes to add
to my reluctance in admitting Mr. Champollion’s reading of
P.T.H; a group which I considered as very probably representing
these letters long before the date of his publications;
though I had only fully identified the two first characters;
it seems to me to agree better with <span class="allcaps">PETEH</span> than with
<span class="allcaps">PHTAH</span>; and I am inclined to think it was the beginning of
the names Petosiris, Peteharpocrates, and other similiar words,
<span class="xxpn" id="p312">[p312]</span>
as it is here annexed to the names of two or three other
deities. But I am by no means confident on the subject;
and beg only to be allowed a few years more to collect further
evidence, without being accused of <em class="italic">resisting</em> conviction.</p>

<p>I must also claim a similar indulgence for my opinion
respecting the bird and the disc; which is so constantly found
between two names, that I could not avoid supposing it to
mean simply <em class="italic">son</em>; I confess that the arguments which Mr.
Champollion has drawn from the application of this character
to some of the Roman names, as well as those which Mr. Salt
has deduced from the inscriptions which he has published,
are at least sufficient to silence me; I had, indeed, long before
observed that the first name of one pair of rings scarcely
ever found as the second of another, though I fancied the
Minervean obelisk might afford an exception. On the other
hand, I cannot explain, upon Mr. Champollion’s theory, the
order of the names in the tablet of Abydus, which might be
supposed to have been purposely intended to perpetuate this
discussion.</p>

<p>It is admitted that this tablet contains the names of a chronological
series of kings, each characterized by one ring, containing
what I have always considered as the true names of the
persons in question. It is easy to grant to him that they are
the praenomens only; as is common in all modern chronology.
But how comes it that there is one exception to this, and that
the reigning monarch is characterized by his second name
only, where he first occurs, and where we should expect to
find his father? This is precisely what would have been
required if the document had been forged to support my
opinion; though I should certainly have been very ungrateful
for an argument, which is more calculated to increase the
difficulty than to remove it.</p>

<p>An objection of a similar nature may be deduced from the
tablet found between the legs of the sphinx, and copied by
Mr. Salt, H. 80. The “Mesphres son of Thuthmosis” of the
Article Egypt is represented naturally enough as doing homage
to his deified father, under the form of an Androsphinx;
had he been doing homage to himself, the names would
scarcely have been so divided. They also occur repeatedly
afterwards in the inscription, but never together.
<span class="xxpn" id="p313">[p313]</span></p>

<p>The tablet represented in Plate 51, is remarkable for the
confirmation which its date affords of the accuracy of our chronology
of the Ptolemies. It has no <em class="italic">pure</em> hieroglyphics. It begins
immediately with “<em class="italic">The year 19, otherwise 4, of Cleopatra
[Neotera], and Ptolemy surnamed Caesar</em>: that is, the year
34 B. C.; and the same date is repeated in a form somewhat
more distinct, four times, in the 10th, 11th, 12th, and
15th lines. In the last it is followed by <em class="italic">the Queen gave to the
Priests and High Priests</em>&#160;.&#160;. then <em class="italic">Ptolemy [Auletes?]&#160;.&#160;.
Queen Cleopatra and King Ptolemy surnamed Caesar</em>.</p>

<p>It has before been observed, that the word <em class="italic">surnamed</em>, as it
occurs in these tablets, and in Mr. Grey’s manuscripts, comprehends
the characters which answer to the
<span class="smcaps">N<span>EO</span></span> of Mr.
Champollion’s
<span class="smcaps">N<span>EOCAESARIS</span></span>. The beginning of the group
occurs elsewhere in the sense of <em class="italic">called</em>, and can scarcely be
read “<span class="allcaps">ETO</span>,” whether we consider the sacred or the enchorial
characters; nor do we find any thing nearer to this in Coptic
than <span class="allcaps">ETE</span>, meaning “<em class="italic">that is</em>,” while the characters are more
like <span class="allcaps">TENE</span>. Such are the uncertainties which continually
beset us in the application of the best established alphabetical
characters even to words of which we know the sounds: to
investigate the unknown by them is at present almost hopeless.</p>

<p>There are two tablets, from the caverns at Sacchara, about
to appear in Plates 70 to 74 of the Hieroglyphics, which
Mr. Salt sent over with particular interest, as being likely to
contain some useful materials for the comparison of the different
kinds of characters with each other. In this point of view,
however, his well-directed zeal has failed of its object: for the
sacred characters relate almost entirely to the gods and priests
of the temple, while the enchorial inscriptions below them
contain dates and records of the successive donations made to
those temples. And this seems to be equally true of the
generality of double inscriptions, which are scarcely ever
identical in this sense, although they may greatly tend to
illustrate each other.</p>

<p>The first in order of these tablets (H 70, 71, 74 A) was
marked number 50 by Mr. Salt; it has seven stars at the edge
of the wings overshadowing the figures. It is first dated very
distinctly <em class="italic">In the year 6 of Cleopatra</em>; which ought to have
<span class="xxpn" id="p314">[p314]</span>
been 6 <em class="italic">otherwise</em> 2; but the second date was perhaps omitted
after an interval of more than 20 years, which must have
elapsed at the time of putting up the tablet, as the subsequent
dates demonstrate. The queen seems to be styled <em class="italic">Isis</em>, but
the name of the “younger goddess,” which is found on her
medals, does not appear in these inscriptions. In the 4th line
the word <em class="italic">Memphis</em> occurs, though less distinctly than elsewhere.
It seems to be formed of characters meaning <em class="italic">Temple</em>,
and <em class="italic">Good</em>, and might naturally be read <span class="allcaps">PHE-NUF</span>; which
agrees sufficiently well with the <span class="allcaps">NOPH</span> of Jeremiah, translated
Memphis by the Septuagint, as well as with the Coptic
<span class="allcaps">PANUF</span>, said to have been <em class="italic">Momemphis</em>. It is possible that
Phthah may have been meant by the Good god, <span class="allcaps">NUF</span>; but
there is here no character at all resembling the Enchorial
name of Phthah, which approaches to that of a figure of 4.</p>

<p>We next find a notice of the change of dynasty (Line 5)&#160;.&#160;.

<span class="smcaps">A<span>UTOCRATOR</span></span>
<span class="smcaps">C<span>AESARIS</span></span> <em class="italic">the Munificent</em>. The
number 7 is indistinct; if correct it must belong to the later
of the double dates of Cleopatra’s reign, which terminated
the 22nd or 7th, the year of the Battle of Actium, in which
the <em class="italic">victory</em> was obtained by the <em class="italic">Emperor</em> Augustus <em class="italic">Caesar</em>.
Then follows a date of the <em class="italic">year</em> 6, probably of Caesar: and
the seven stars of the wings may possibly relate to the erection
of the tablet in the subsequent year. We have also a donation
of <em class="italic">gold and silver gems</em>.</p>

<p>The second tablet (H 72, 73, 74 B) has first the date of
the <em class="italic">year 19 of King Ptolemy</em> [Auletes] the <em class="italic">Defender of the
sacred rites</em> (L. 3)&#160;.&#160;. <em class="italic">The year 4 of Cleopatra ‘Neotera?</em>

abundance, gave them to the sanctuary of the great god in the

gems and silver</em>&#160;.&#160;. (9) <em class="italic">Memphis</em>.</p>

<p>We have here no subsequent year 19 to which the stars of
the margin can refer: and it seems therefore most natural to
<span class="xxpn" id="p315">[p315]</span>
suppose that they belong to the earliest date, with which the
tablet commences: and perhaps the seven stars of the former
may have been marked by mistake for six. The interpretation
of the marginal stars will be easily brought to the test of
future observations.</p>

<p>Plates 75 and 76 contain portions of a large tablet from
Sacchara, very fairly written on chalk, of which the upper
part is broken off, leaving only a few traces of a hieroglyphic
inscription, which seems to have contained a date at the end,
perhaps the 12th of Mechir.</p>

<p>In the 79th plate there are four enchorial lines very distinctly
written, and beginning with a date, which must be
either 24 or 28, and most probably the latter, as there are 28
stars in the margin: perhaps the 11th of the month, in the
reign of <em class="italic">Ptolemy the son of Ptolemy, may he live for ever</em>.
The rest is not intelligible.</p>

<p class="spctop">In this manner, my dear Sir, I have been creeping, while
others have been flying, though perhaps a little too near the
sun. Possibly my friend Champollion, and <em class="italic">your friend</em>
Seyffarth, would be able to decipher much more of these
inscriptions; and it is probable that their versions might
differ in almost every particular. In this case it is unnecessary
for me to say which of the two explanations I should
be inclined to prefer: for it is impossible to deny to Champollion
the merit of great industry, and deep, as well as
extensive research. I object only to his precipitation, and his
love of system, which, I think, cause him to be led away by his
own ingenuity, through a series of conclusions unsupported
by sufficient evidence.
<span class="xxpn" id="p316">[p316]</span></p>

<p>As an instance of a hasty and undemonstrated assertion, I
shall mention his explanation of the group of characters which
he considers (Système, p. 82) as “forming the third person
plural of the future in all the verbs of the last nine lines of the
hieroglyphical text of Rosetta, expressing the different dispositions
of the decree, and answering to Greek verbs, which are
always in the infinitive,” and which he naturally enough
reads <span class="allcaps">SNE</span>.</p>

<p>There is nothing absolutely incorrect in this statement, but
the reader naturally infers from it that the group in question
occurs either exclusively or principally in these nine lines.
The fact is, however, that in the first five lines, or rather half
lines, the group is found ten times, and in the remaining nine,
only eighteen, that is, about half as frequently, in proportion to
the actual length of the lines: nor can I find any where a
context that favours Mr. Champollion’s interpretation; though
I have lately observed that an Enchorial group, resembling ´O,
is found almost uniformly to answer to the Greek infinitive:
being read perhaps <span class="allcaps">MNR</span> or <span class="allcaps">MARE</span>: but I cannot make
these characters agree either with the hieroglyphics in question,
or with the sounds <span class="allcaps">SNE</span>, which Mr. Champollion attributes
to them.</p>

<p>So little is Mr. Champollion in the habit of distinguishing
<em class="italic">proofs</em> from <em class="italic">assertions</em> in his own case, that it is the less surprising
that he should sometimes confound them with respect
to others. He says, for example, with respect to the nature of
the Hieratic characters, which he explained to the Academy of
Belles Lettres in 1821, “<em class="italic">je me suis convaincu depuis que M. le
Dr. Young avait publié avant moi ce même résultat, et de plus,
que nous avions été</em>
<span class="smmaj">PREVENUS</span> <em class="italic">de quelques années, l’un et
l’autre, quant au</em> principe de cette découverte et sa définition,
par M. Tychsen de Goettingue.” (p. 20.) Professor Tychsen
had <em class="italic">asserted</em> this agreement as a probable opinion: it was
amply <em class="italic">demonstrated</em> in 1816; <em class="italic">five years</em> afterwards Mr.
Champollion thinks he has a right to consider himself as a
new inventor of the doctrine, because he chose to neglect what
was done in a neighbouring country, and to undervalue the
actual <em class="italic">proof</em>, in which he had been anticipated, by classing it
with a bare <em class="italic">assertion</em> to be found in a German publication.
<span class="xxpn" id="p317">[p317]</span>
Precisely in the same spirit he remarks, in the next page, that
Barthélemy and Zoëga had <em class="italic">pointed</em> out the rings as containing
proper names: they had, indeed, <em class="italic">said</em> that they might be
proper names, <em class="italic">or</em> moral sentences, <em class="italic">or</em> something else; but the
only question was, if it was worth questioning at all, to whom
belonged the priority of the <em class="italic">demonstration</em> that they actually
were proper names: which, before the publication of the
Archaeologia for 1814, was no where to be found. This publication
was the first great step after the discovery of the pillar
of Rosetta: the second was the identification of the different
kinds of characters, in 1816, by means of the Déscription de
l’Egypte: the third, the application of that identification to the
names of Ptolemy and Berenice: the fourth, perhaps, was
Mr. Bankes’s discovery in Egypt, of the name of Cleopatra,
which he sent to Paris: and on these grounds is certainly
<em class="italic">founded</em>
<span class="smmaj">ALL</span> that is at present known of Egyptian literature,
for a very considerable proportion of which we are unquestionably
indebted to Mr. Champollion.</p>

<p class="spctop">The French translator of Mr. Browne’s ingenious articles
which appeared in the Edinburgh Review, has certainly gone
a good deal out of his way to find matter of accusation against
Mr. Champollion. He quotes the text of a memoir published
in 1821, and afterwards <em class="italic">suppressed</em>, in order to show that
Mr. Champollion then continued to believe that the hieroglyphics
were signs of things and not of sounds; and that he
disagreed with those learned persons who had considered the
hieratic writing as alphabetical. The date of this suppressed
paper is indeed of some consequence, as determining the
period at which Mr. Champollion made his rediscovery of
what Dr. Young had published in 1816; that is, the fact of
the essential identity of the two systems of writing. But the
translator might have found in the beginning of the letter to
Mr. Dacier, dated in 1822, the same opinion respecting these
systems of writing; that is, the <em class="italic">hieratic</em> and <em class="italic">demotic</em>, which,
he says, are not alphabetic, but “<em class="italic">ideographic</em>, like the hieroglyphics
themselves,” expressing ideas and not sounds: and he
adds, that <em class="italic">he</em> (!) has deduced from the demotic inscription of
Rosetta a series of characters which have a “<em class="italic">syllabico-alphabetic</em>
<span class="xxpn" id="p318">[p318]</span>
value,” by which foreign proper names were expressed.
(p. 2.)</p>

<p>Nothing can possibly agree better than this with the opinions
which Dr. Young had long before published; and which he
has since confirmed in his octavo volume; and if Mr. Champollion’s
ideas upon this subject have sometimes appeared to
fluctuate, it has probably been more from a love of system,
and a wish to establish originality, than from any new discoveries
that he can have made respecting these two modes of
writing in particular.</p>

<p>What precise forms of characters may be supposed to answer
to the sense in which Mr. Champollion employs the word
demotic, cannot very easily be ascertained. It is remarkable
that his “<span class="allcaps">SNE</span>” is a group very commonly found in the
manuscripts of the Déscription de l’Egypte, which Mr. Champollion
might possibly call demotic; while it cannot be identified
in the Enchorial Inscription of Rosetta. This is an
instance of the difficulty of finding appropriate terms where
we have not exact definitions. The difficulty is not avoided
by the use of the word Enchorial, except that it may with
perfect safety be applied to such inscriptions as are capable of
having any of their words identified with the inscription so
called on the pillar itself.</p>

<p>The verification of the chronology of Manetho must naturally
be a work of time, even after the complete identification
of the names of the kings, which cannot <em class="italic">yet</em> be admitted to be
satisfactory. There is one discordance that it may be right
slightly to point out, as it is presented by Plate 43 of the
Hieroglyphics: we there find the 29th year of the Sesenchosis
of Manetho; and Manetho allots but 21 years to this king,
who was the first of his dynasty, and could not, therefore, like
Philadelphus, have continued any era from an earlier period.</p>

<p>It is easy to observe, in comparing Mr. Cailliaud’s copy of
the Tablet of Abydus, as published by Mr. Champollion, with
those of our countrymen, Mr. Bankes and Mr. Wilkinson,
contained in the 47th plate of the Hieroglyphics, or with the
manuscript copy of Mr. Burton, how much more hastily the
French traveller had executed his task than <em class="italic">any one</em> of the
three Englishmen.
<span class="xxpn" id="p319">[p319]</span></p>

<p>Another of Mr. Wilkinson’s very valuable inscriptions, from
a temple at Kous, must be allowed to give evidence much
more favourable to Mr. Champollion, as far as it regards the
signification of the <em class="italic">plough</em>, which seems to enter into the composition
of <em class="italic">Philometor</em>, as applied to Cleopatra and “Ptolemy
Alexander,” who are called Philometores Soteres, both here
and in Anastasy’s Greek Manuscript. The name of Alexander
had never occurred to the author of the article
<span class="smcaps">E<span>GYPT</span></span>, but he
had evidently a foresight in what way it would make its appearance
when he observed, N. 55, “it will appear hereafter,
that a knowledge of the enchorial forms may possibly contribute
very materially, at some future time, to assist us in determining
it:” and he immediately proceeds to the subject of
<span class="smmaj">PHONETIC HIEROGLYPHICS</span>.</p>

<p>The plough seems to be exchanged on the Minervean obelisk
for the dentated quadrant and chain, which may hence have
been synonymous with the dentated parallelogram or comb:
both perhaps having represented instruments which bore the
same name, and served the same purposes, though of different
forms: they may, for instance, have been rakes or harrows,
and may hence have borne some analogy to the plough or hoe.
Whether they had names beginning with M, may still be
questionable.</p>

<p>Mr. Champollion has endeavoured to explain the absence of
the names of our queens from the tablet of Abydus, by saying
that it must be considered as a tablet “purely <em class="italic">genealogical</em>.”
First Letter to the D. de B. p. 89. A reader is naturally disposed
to acquiesce in this explanation, since Mr. Champollion,
who has carefully examined it, asserts it on his own credit;
especially as the assertion appears to be supported by a long
and minute discussion. Unhappily, however, it is only necessary
to compare his brother’s chronology in P. 107, with his
own Plates <span class="allcaps">II</span>. and <span class="allcaps">III</span>. fig. 5, from which it appears that
Amenses, who <em class="italic">reigned</em> more than 20 years, was the mother of
Thuthmosis the second, whose name is in the tablet, while his
mother’s is <em class="italic">omitted</em>. It is true that, with his usual ingenuity,
Mr. Champollion seems afterwards to change his ground in
the same page: for he says, that one only of two brothers
or sisters was inserted, in order to keep the number of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p320">[p320]</span>
<em class="italic">generations</em> unaltered: and he might have added that Amenses
was the sister of Amenophis, whom she succeeded. If he had
stated this clearly, the reader might have judged for himself,
whether such a coincidence was or was not sufficient to support
the chronology of Manetho; which was, however, by no
means in want of <em class="italic">such</em> support: in the article
<span class="smcaps">E<span>GYPT</span></span>, for
example, Manetho’s chronology of this dynasty is fully
adopted: and the same ‘cartouche’ is read <em class="italic">Thuthmosis</em>, which
Mr. Champollion, after all his parade, still admits to be
Thuthmosis: nor is there a difference of half a century in the
dates assigned to his reign by various chronologists. It was
established in the article Egypt, that the name contained that
of Thoth, the Egyptian Hermes, and for this reason it was considered
as better established than any other of the names of
the Pharaohs. Mr. Champollion had never discovered this
for many years afterwards: and yet we have been told by an
<span class="smcaps">E<span>NGLISHMAN</span></span> in the last Quarterly Journal, that to Mr. Champollion
the <em class="italic">greater part</em> of the <em class="italic">discoveries</em> made by the interpretation
of hieroglyphics are owing!</p>

<h3><em class="italic">On the Naturalization
of Fish. By</em> J. Mac Culloch, M.D., F.R.S., &#38;c. <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>As I promised you that I would communicate to you,
from time to time, any new remarks or facts which might occur
on the subject of naturalizing sea-fish in fresh water, I am pleased
to have an opportunity of noticing a few circumstances which
may serve to keep alive in the public mind a subject, from
which I cannot yet help foreboding useful results, in spite of the
neglect and opposition which it has experienced from every
person, I believe I may safely say, to whom it has been proposed,
except Mr. Arnold. I am perfectly safe in saying, that,
with this sole exception, every individual to whom the facts
have been described, and the experiment proposed, have replied
by doubts, or cavils, or objections of some kind; many, by
<span class="xxpn" id="p321">[p321]</span>
positive disbelief of the very facts; while the far greater number
have been persons, whose entire ignorance of every requisite
point of physiology, natural history, and chemistry, must, of
course, have rendered their objections sufficiently unworthy of
notice, though not sufficient to restrain the confidence with
which they have been urged. The satirical writers of the day
view this as the character of the age: the more obvious aspect
which this disposition presents, is the feeling, as if he who attempted,
by suggesting an improvement, to render a service, was
meditating an injury, and was an enemy to be opposed at all
hazards. I must permit you to settle metaphysical and moral
questions so profound as to exceed my own ingenuity.</p>

<p>But I cannot avoid regretting that Mr. Arnold is not the rich
and idle proprietor of some of the tens of thousands of acres of
fresh water, whether Scotch or English, in which a ‘sea-fish
cannot possibly live,’ or ‘would certainly not be eatable’: and,
in addition, that, instead of a not very opulent and very busied
‘notary public,’ he was not in possession of some five thousand
of these acres, with as much money, and as much leisure. And
I feel bound to add to this apology for what he <em class="italic">has not</em> yet
done, that the expense of such a course of experiments is considerable;
at least in this comparison. A superintendent would
be necessary; and for the purpose of taking and transporting
the fish, still more of drawing nets periodically and frequently,
to ascertain the progress of the transplanted fish, there must
be expensive assistance, for which, as yet, there can be no returns;
while that, in addition to irregularities and rocks in the
pond itself, impeding the accurate drawing and examination,
must also be the apology for the imperfection of the present additional
report as to the success for certain fishes. It is plain
that, though ten or a hundred turbots were present in a pond of
four or five acres, the fact is not one that can easily be ascertained.
Let those who have money, leisure, and water, and
nothing else towards the investigation of this object, restrain, at
least, <em class="italic">their</em> incredulity and opposition; as may also they, very
safely, who never saw a fish, except on the stall of a London
fishmonger.</p>

<p>With respect now to some facts: it had been said that the
water was salt, because this pond was situated at a sea
<span class="xxpn" id="p322">[p322]</span>
embankment. I stated before, that it admitted the sea, by leakage, in
summer, when there was little comparative supply of fresh
water, and was therefore brackish, or saline. I have since
ascertained the exact proportion of salt in the water, at those
times when the fresh water is least. In the driest and hottest
part of one summer, the proportion of salt in it, as compared to
the sea without, was as 40 to 150. In another, peculiarly dry,
1827, it was one half; and the water, having then been at the
lowest, it cannot ever be computed to exceed this. Moreover,
this period of saltness cannot easily, even in such a summer,
occupy more than the months of June, July, August, and September;
or, more strictly speaking, it is probable, scarcely one
half of that time in general, in so rainy a climate; a climate
equalling Penzance in the quantity of rain.</p>

<p>In winter, that is, during five or six months, or less, if any
objector pleases, it is fresh. That cattle drink it freely, is not
an exact chemical proof; but I must admit, that I have not
analyzed the water at that period, holding the objection in great
contempt. It may be sufficient to say, that it then occupies a
space of about sixteen acres, or increases to this magnitude
from four and a half acres; so that it cannot, at least, be very
salt, while the fish, and the mullet in particular, are found in
the remotest ditches, among the meadows. But, in defect of
an analysis, which I have not had the means of making, there
is a valid reason why the water should be fresh when the size
of the pond is much extended. The presence of sea-water in
it, is, in all cases, the consequence of a depression of the water
within the sea-wall, which allows of leakage or infiltration at
the upper part, so as, in high tides, to equalize, as far can be
done in the short period of high water, the levels within and
without. This, it is plain, must cease whenever the water
within is higher than the sea without; and hence it is that there
can be no access for the salt water in the winter or rainy
months.</p>

<p>Enough of the mere fact: the objections derived from which
ought not to demand an answer among physiologists; while to
those who argue physiological points in utter ignorance of all
that belongs to physiology, it is probable that all answer is
fruitless. It was stated before—the question is simply twofold;
<span class="xxpn" id="p323">[p323]</span>
respiration and food. If fish can breathe indifferently salt water
or fresh, for one week or one month, and if, in their new element,
translated from salt to fresh, they thrive or grow, fatten
and breed, the trial of three weeks or three months is a sufficient
proof that they will neither sicken nor die of fresh water. If
they can find food, it is indifferent whether the medium is fresh
or salt. It is the misfortune of the age to understand every
thing without knowing its principles; just as every man is now
a physician. A few, more profound, who chance to know that
salmon divide their time between fresh and salt water, possess
other reasons, and find other objections; which they must be
permitted to explain for themselves. I ought not, while on this
particular subject, to omit one fact, which has come to my
knowledge since the former papers were written, on the voluntary
emigration of a fish, supposed to be peculiarly delicate and
peculiarly attached to the sea, into fresh water. This is, that, in
Virginia, the herring ascends the rivers, even up into the most
minute communicating branches, and as far as it can reach;
while a somewhat recent traveller describes them as being so
abundant, that it is impossible to cross the fords on horseback
during the season of their migration, without destroying them
by the horse’s feet. To proceed to the <em class="italic">historical</em> condition of
this pond.</p>

<p>I have already stated the difficulties arising from want of
leisure and wealth in the proprietor, added to non-residence I
should say, whence chiefly has arisen the difficulty of tracing
the results. Let those try for themselves, who consider that all
this might have been ascertained in a twelvemonth, and
with the same means. Since the communications I formerly
made, the Pilchard has been introduced. It swam away briskly,
therefore it would not die of the fresh water; but it has not
been retaken. The retaking of individual fish, to ascertain their
presence, is a fundamental difficulty, as I before pointed out.</p>

<p>The Brill has also been introduced since my former list. It
has been retaken; and, within one year, had grown to double
the original size.</p>

<p>The Turbot. Fifty or sixty were introduced, averaging about
eight inches in length. Some were retaken in a year, for the
purpose of examination merely, like the former and most others;
<span class="xxpn" id="p324">[p324]</span>
they also had grown to double the size. There is no prospect
of dying in these cases, it is abundantly plain; that they will
breed is probable, but there has been no time, nor would the
young have been taken. What is to prevent healthy fishes
from breeding? The young, indeed, may be eaten; if so, it is
for want of room, or want of a proper balance in this mixed
population. No one knows any thing, either of the ordinary
growth, propagation, or destruction of fishes; and how then can
any one decide on what is regular or extraordinary?</p>

<p>The Wrasse has been retaken after a considerable period;
therefore it is not dead.</p>

<p>The Basse has propagated; and so has the Brill.</p>

<p>The Red Mullet has been introduced, and is living.</p>

<p>The Whiting was introduced, and taken in good health many
weeks after, but not since.</p>

<p>The Grey Loach is thought to have bred considerably.</p>

<p>The Atherine continues to breed.</p>

<p>I formerly mentioned that the flavour of the several fishes
was improved: this is now more positively asserted, in addition,
of the Basse, the Plaice, and the Red Loach. Others were
mentioned in former communications.</p>

<p>Loss of property, or flavour, has been made a speculative
objection by the unvarying objectors. General experience has
shown, that in all fishes, as far as known, the access to fresh
water, or fresh water food, improved the flavour; in many, in
oysters, muscles, cockles, shrimps, it is vulgarly notorious; as
in mere sea water they are worthless.</p>

<p>There is a popular objection, on this head, made by the
country gentlemen, which I must answer; to those who <em class="italic">think</em>
about what they know, it would have been superfluous. The
salmon is good when it comes from the sea, and bad when it is
returning. Doubtless, it is; while the reason ought to be plain,
even to an angler. It is in full health in the first case: in the
latter, it has spawned; and, at that period, every fish is proportionally
as bad as the salmon; many are a great deal worse.
The fault is not in the water, nor probably in the food; it is in
the spawning, and with any food the same effect takes place, in
all fishes, everywhere.</p>

<p>I suggested in former communications, that an essential point
<span class="xxpn" id="p325">[p325]</span>
to ascertain, in any view of economy, or management, would be
the proper balance of species; to discover what kinds would so
live together that all the species might find food; might breed,
each to its useful limits, so as to be serviceable to ourselves, the
keepers or the flocks, and without hazard of the extermination
of any kind. I may illustrate what is here meant, by a simple
fact, in the ordinary economy of fresh water fishes in confinement.
Pike and perch can live together, because the natural
defences of the perch prevent the pike from exterminating the
race, voracious as the enemy is. If trout and pike were confined
in a narrow water, the trout would be destroyed.</p>

<p>Or otherwise, it must be our object to ascertain, in an economical
view, how to feed, by means of species that we do not
desire to eat, those which we do cultivate for our own uses.
This is a difficult question, which can only be overcome by
time and experience; by knowledge; by knowledge, when we
are in a state of entire ignorance; ignorance of every thing that
relates to fishes, as great as if they were the inhabitants of
another planet. This was one great source of difficulties with
us in this case; and I, myself, must plead guilty, I fear, to a
general recommendation of introducing every fish as a mere
matter of trial; the result of which has been mischievous. The
basse appears to have been the great enemy; to have eaten up
the greater number of many species, and given no return. It
has proved the pike of this pond. This could not have been
foreseen; it is a caution for future speculators. Others will be
discovered in the course of trial. It appears also that the common
crab has proved destructive, probably by eating the spawn
of larger fishes. From some enemy or other, the eels, which at
first abounded to an incredible degree, have most materially
diminished, and so have the shrimps. The latter, at least, appear
to have been destroyed by the basse. Time and trial will
teach us what to do in this case; in the infancy of ignorance,
man might have supposed that he could keep wolves and sheep
in one field, and have constructed a pen for foxes and fowls,
rabbits and weasels. We must not accuse nature of our own
ignorance.</p>

<p>The question is here a difficult one; but a little more study
<span class="xxpn" id="p326">[p326]</span>
of the general habits of fishes, merely as we know them already,
and even of their anatomy, will go far to lay the foundation of
useful rules on this head, even without a hazardous trial, which
may ultimately not become in our power to remedy, as I much
fear may prove the case with respect to these unlucky basse.
Not to enter on this further than as it may serve for a general
illustration of what is here meant, the anatomy of the mullet
proves that it lives on worms; on the lumbricus marinus, and
others; and so do its habits. So also may the very food of
others, as found in the stomach, serve to indicate their natural
or ordinary food. Reversely, the anatomy of a cod’s jaws, and
its stomach also, prove it to be omnivorous, omnivoracious.
Or, further, the anatomical character of the diodon proves that
it eats shell-fish; as we are equally able to limit the range of
food in the flat-fish which have no air-bladders, and cannot
quit the ground.</p>

<p>But in this brief communication, I must not enter further
into this subject than is necessary for mere illustration. I may
take some further opportunity to point out the probabilities, as
to mutual food and protection, in any artificial cultivation of
this nature, as they might be derived from studying the little
that we do know about the structure and habits of fishes. All
that I need add here, is, that I have suggested the introduction
of limpets, periwinkles, and cockles; as affording food without
furnishing enemies: a matter which had been overlooked. To
exterminate the enemies which have been unwarily introduced,
will not prove so easy a task; unless, at least, we could find
their natural enemies; find the great secret by which alone,
in all cases, man can make war on those whom neither his
artillery, his physic, nor his politics can reach.</p>

<p>The transportation of fishes has been objected to as difficult.
I had occasion to make some remarks on this formerly, and on
the vitality of some kinds. The difficulty is not so great as
has been imagined. The fact generally is, that fishermen,
even down to the very sentimentalists who worship the gentle
Izaak, and who are sometimes scarcely possessed of the wit of
a fish, treat them as they would a stone; as if they had not
lives, and wills, and opinions, and were not part of the same
<span class="xxpn" id="p327">[p327]</span>
creation as ourselves; as if that creation, which outnumbers
ourselves by millions of millions almost beyond algebra to
express, was not, like ourselves, under His care. They are
easily killed by violence; they kill themselves by over-exertion,
from anatomical peculiarities; as every trout-fisher knows;
that is to say, the fact, not the cause. Let them be treated
with gentleness when taken, as if they could feel; and they
will not die in being removed into a cask of water. The flat
fish are all peculiarly tenacious of life, so are all those of firm
muscles generally: the vitality of the carp and of the minnow
also is notorious; and so it is as to many other kinds. All
these can be removed, and carried far, even in straw; but in
truth, he who chooses to make his experiments like a philosopher,
and who desires to succeed, will not fail.</p>

<p>Yet let me point out what I have suggested to Mr. Arnold,
among other things: to him, whose merit as an ardent experimenter,
always ready to adopt a reasonable suggestion, and
never seeking for an objection, ought to stamp his character as
a genuine follower of the true philosophy; the exception, in
this particular case, to every one else. This is, to adopt the
Chinese method of transporting the spawn of fishes; as affording
a far greater facility to the introduction of species. I presume
that the general fact must be known to your readers; though I
believe that I ought to doubt: because I quoted the same
practice from Columella formerly, as in use among the most
ancient Romans, among the common farmers.</p>

<p>This substance is perpetually brought up by the trawl net, very
injuriously, as it relates to fisheries; and in many cases, the
fishermen contrive to guess tolerably well to what fish it belongs.
That it may be transported to any distance, the familiar practice
of China proves: since it is there a common article of sale in the
markets; while there also, I may incidentally remark, the cultivation
of fish for sale, their transportation to market, and their
replacement in the ponds, if unsold, is as much matter of ordinary
farming as the management of a poultry-yard; while the pond
is often the most profitable part of the farm. They also, who
do not already chance to know it, may be informed, that this
species of poultry-yard, or fish-pond, is as easily and regularly
<span class="xxpn" id="p328">[p328]</span>
stocked in this manner, and managed, as any other portion of
the farm: since it is even destroyed, or suffered to become dry
occasionally, and again renewed in the wet season, by the means
of purchased spawn, or stock; just as a sheep farmer buys
lambs to stock his mountains. If England is too wise to learn
of Rome or China, or of France and Germany, or even of the
experiments on which I have dwelt so much and so often, it
must be a pleasing reflection that it is already so amply informed
as to have passed the bounds of all possible improvement and
all possible wishes. But that I may terminate this particular
suggestion, I will only further point out, that lobsters, and the
crab tribe generally, might very easily be transported in this
manner, and that, in them, it is easily known when the <em class="italic">ovum</em>
has been impregnated, by means of a black spot with which it
is then marked.</p>

<p>If I ought to apologize already for the length of this communication,
I shall conclude it by saying, that whatever may
be judged of the general philosophy of this subject, there is
not and never has been any thing to prevent the cultivation of
fish, in ponds of salt-water at least, or the preservation of them
in any water in which they will live for a sufficient length of
time, so as to render that a depôt for the purposes of a fish
store, calculated for the steady supply of a market, in the
manner which I formerly described and proposed. If, after so
many years as this proposal has been made, London has not
seen either the facility, or the utility, it will discover them at
some future day; just as it discovered, ten years after there
had been twenty-six steam-boats on the Clyde, that a steam-boat
might possibly be of use on the Thames; just as it opposed
gas-lights, and just as it has adopted gas-lights.

are so closely allied as to form a whole, and also because
<em class="italic">Nugæ Canoræ</em> and <em class="italic">Nugæ Chirurgicæ</em> bear internal evidence
of being written by the same pen; and when we say further,
that they are characterized by good feeling and good humour,
we are sure we are not far off in our <em class="italic">guess</em> about who
is ‘<span class="smcaps">U<span>NUS</span></span>
<span class="smcaps">Q<span>UORUM</span></span>.’
These volumes come within the scope of our
Journal, as comprising an outline of the history of medical
science, sketched in a vein of pleasantry that makes it no
less agreeable to the general than to the professional reader,
and we have derived both amusement and information from
its perusal. Like the ‘Gold Headed Cane,’ it helps us to
much curious modern biographical anecdote, with the addition
of varied entertainment for the medical antiquary.
While, however, we recommend these ‘Mems.,’ and commend
the literary loungings of contemporary practitioners,
we cannot but regret the neglected volumes of Aikin and
Walker, and lament that the lack of feeling for the annals
and literature of their profession, should be less active in
the medical public of this country, than with our professional
brethren on the Continent.</p>

<p>‘<em class="italic">Nugæ Chirurgicæ</em>’ is a <em class="italic">Catalogue Raisonnée</em> of a scarce
collection of Medical Portraits. We believe only 250 copies
were printed; from which circumstance, and its recording
the congregation of the greatest assemblage of medical men
ever met together, it is probable that it may some day
become a medical rarity. The author’s original intention
appears merely to have been to describe the portrait, with
some characteristic trait; but an after-thought seems to have
occurred, and in the “Memorabilia,” the “<em class="italic">Medici Family</em>”
are, as it were, retouched and varnished, so as to become
<span class="xxpn" id="p330">[p330]</span>
very agreeable pictures. We shall now present our readers
with a few specimens of this gallery, taken at random.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="allcaps">EURICUS</span> <span class="allcaps">CORDUS</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cordus, who was accustomed to receive his fees only at the
termination of patient’s disease, describes, in a facetious epigram,
the practitioner at three different times, in three different
characters.</p>

<p>Three faces wears the doctor; when first sought
An angel’s—and a god’s the cure half wrought:
But when, that cure complete, he seeks his fee,
The devil looks then less terrible than he.</p>

<p>“The epigram of Cordus is illustrated by the following conversation,
which passed between Bovart and a French marquis,
whom he had attended during a long and severe indisposition.
As he entered the chamber on a certain occasion, he was thus
addressed by his patient: ‘Good day to you, Mr. Bouvart; I feel
quite in spirits, and think my fever has left me.’ ‘I am sure of
it,’ replied the doctor; ‘the very first expression you used convinces
me of it.’ ‘Pray explain yourself.’ ‘Nothing more easy:
in the first days of your illness, when your life was in danger, I
was your <em class="italic">dearest friend</em>; as you began to get better, I was your
<em class="italic">good Bouvart</em>; and now I am Mr. Bouvart: depend upon it you
are quite recovered.’ Bouvart’s observation was grounded on a
knowledge of human nature: every day’s experience shows, that
‘<em class="italic">accipe dum dolet</em>’ should be the medical man’s motto.</p>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allcaps">JOHN</span> <span class="allcaps">CASE</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In one of the profound pieces of astrological bombast written
by this singular genius, he gives an account of the creation of
Adam: ‘<em class="italic">Thus</em> Adam was created in that pleasant place <em class="italic">Paradise</em>,
about the year before Christ 4002, viz. on April 24, at twelve
o’clock, or midnight.’ His name was latinized to <em class="italic">Caseus</em>, which
was occasionally interpreted Dr. <em class="italic">Cheese</em>. Granger says the following
anecdote of Case was communicated to him by the Rev.
Mr. Gosling, in these terms: ‘Dr. Maundy, formerly of Canterbury,
told me, that in his travels abroad, some eminent physician,
who had been in England, gave him a token to spend at his
return with Dr. Radcliffe and Dr. Case. They fixed on an evening,
and were very merry, when Radcliffe thus began a health:
‘Here, brother Case, to all the fools your patients.’ ‘I thank
you, good brother,’ replied Case; ‘let me have all the fools, and
you are heartily welcome to the rest of the practice.’’</p>

<p class="center"><span class="allcaps">THOMAS</span> <span class="allcaps">DAWSON</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The following anecdote is related of him: After he became
M.D. he attended his neighbour Miss Corbett, of Hackney, who
<span class="xxpn" id="p331">[p331]</span>
was indisposed; and found her one day sitting solitary, piously
and pensively musing upon the Bible, when, <em class="italic">by some strange accident</em>,
his eyes were directed to the passage where Nathan says to
David, ‘Thou art the Man.’ The doctor profited by the kind
hint; and, after a proper time allowed for drawing up articles
of capitulation, the lady, on 29th May, 1758, surrendered herself
up to all his prescriptions, and the doctor very speedily performed
a perfect cure.</p>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allcaps">PHILIP</span> <span class="allcaps">HECQUET</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘C’est une erreur de penser que le sang soit nécessaire à la
conservation de la vie; on ne peut trop saigner un malade;’ are
the words put into the mouth of our doctor, in the character of
Sangrado by the facetious Le Sage. Hecquet, both in theory
and practice, carried the <em class="italic">anti-phlogistic</em> system to a greater extent
than any other man, and defended the ‘<em class="italic">boisson</em>’ and the <em class="italic">bleeding</em>,
saying, ‘J’ai pour garants de mon sentiment, sur le <em class="italic">Régime
maigre</em>, les médecins les plus fameux, tant anciens que modernes.’
He was a conscientious practitioner of his own eccentric doctrines,
and it was perfectly consistent with his character, that ‘loin
d’imputer la mort du chanoine à la boisson et aux saignées, il
sortit en disant, d’un air froid, qu’on ne lui avait pas tiré <em class="italic">assez de
sang</em>, ni fait boire <em class="italic">assez d’eau chaude</em>.’</p>

<p>“The practice of <em class="italic">bleeding</em> was carried to a singular extent in
France, and it was the fashion, at one time, to bleed on the opposite
side to the part affected; if the pain was on the right side,
they bled in the left arm, and <em class="italic">vice versâ</em>. Pierre Brissot produced
a civil war in the medical world by writing against the custom,
and, in the year 1600, was driven into exile, by edict of the
University of Paris, for thus opposing the established practice.</p>

<p>He read the lecture founded by Dr. Caldwell, at Barber-surgeons’
Hall, for many years; where he was the first who attempted to
account for muscular strength and motion on geometrical principles.
He was a man of amiable manners and great vivacity of
conversation. Seeing the Duchess of Portsmouth eat to excess,
he said to her, with his usual frankness, ‘Madam, I will deal with
you as a physician should do; <em class="italic">you must eat less, use more exercise,
take physic, or be sick</em>.’</p>

<p>“Was a great enemy to quackery and quacks, of whom he used
<span class="xxpn" id="p332">[p332]</span>
to say that there were not such liars in the world, except their
patients. A relation of his, one day, asking his opinion of a
certain work on fevers, he observed, ‘I do not like fever curers;
we <em class="italic">may guide</em> a fever—we cannot <em class="italic">cure</em> it. What would you think
of a pilot who attempted to quell a storm? Either position is
equally absurd. We must steer the ship as well as we can in a
storm; and in a fever we can only employ patience and judicious
measures, to meet the difficulties of the case.’”</p></div>

<p>Turn we now to the second article in our list,—<em class="italic">Nugæ
Canoræ</em>; and we are satisfied that our readers will agree
with us in the correctness of our <em class="italic">guess</em>. It is the production,
at any rate, of one who has lived much in the medical
world, and no unobservant spectator of the vices and virtues,
the feelings and failings of contemporary practitioners,
possessing tact to “catch the manners living as they rise.”
In short, it is a pleasant <em class="italic">jeu d’esprit</em>; and we hail it as
an omen, that in these “piping times of peace,” the days of
Garth, Goldsmith, and Darwin may be revived, and that
the medical fraternity may again employ their <em class="italic">leisure</em> hours
in amusements for which their education and intercourse
with society so well qualify them.</p>

<p>After a humorous preface, in which the removal of the
College of Physicians to Pall-mall East is lamented, the
work, for very satisfactory reasons, is dedicated to the
Presidents of the two Colleges and to the Master of the
Company of Apothecaries, for the year 1927—and as a
character in one of Foote’s farces wishes he were to be born
“fifty years hence,” so should we like to have a peep at the
“Clines and Coopers,” the “Halfords and Warrens,” of
that day. We wish, with the author, that they may be
as distinguished ornaments of their profession as those of
our own.</p>

<p>That the old college should still be preserved for medical
purposes, it is proposed to turn it into a “Medical Mausoleum,”
where the “Medical Fraternity” are to be buried
on the same terms as the Parisians are at Père la Chaise—and
then follow the supposed Epitaphs of the present race
of the “Medici.” Due honour is done to learning and
talents; while quackery, in all its ramifications, meets with
just castigation. The names of Heberden, Turton, and
Baker are noticed with the respect to which their virtues
and acquirements entitle them.</p>

legitimately before us, and is a novelty in medical literature—a
sort of <em class="italic">Sketch Book</em>, containing much entertaining anecdote,
that makes the information it contains extremely
amusing.</p>

<p>The work is divided into three parts, as the alliterated
title quaintly informs us—Mems., Maxims, and Memoirs.
The first is a chronological record, giving, as it were, a
“bird’s eye view” of the most interesting events in the
history of medicine, from the time of the conquest up to the
<span class="xxpn" id="p336">[p336]</span>
present century. The second consists of comments, or short
essays, illustrative of some of the most important facts; and
the third of biographical anecdotes.</p>

<p>Under the head of “<em class="italic">Medical Books</em>,” we are presented
with curious specimens of our earliest writers, with comments;
but let the author speak for himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One of the first of our English writers, is John of Gaddesden,
whose ‘Rosa Anglica,’ was greatly esteemed, and he is favourably
mentioned by Chaucer. John was a man to whom nothing came
amiss; he had an anodyne necklace for fits, and an infallible
cataplasm for gout; he was a dexterous bone-setter, and a good
dentist. He was very assiduous in inventing lotions for ladies’
complexions; and was complaisant enough to cut their corns;
and as for those troublesome animalcules, which, in those days,
used to infest <em class="italic">gentlemen’s</em> heads, he had a most effectual method
of destroying them; and in his celebrated book, he favours us
with a whimsical cure for small-pox.—‘Immediately after the
eruption, cause the whole body of your patient to be wrapped in
red scarlet cloth, or in any other red cloth, and command everything
about the bed to be made red. This is an excellent cure.
It was in this manner I treated the son of the noble King of England,
when he had the small-pox; and I cured him, without
leaving any marks.’</p>

<p>“Such was our countryman, John of Gaddesden, who deserves
notice, moreover, as being the first English surgeon employed at
court; and that the King (Edward <span class="allcaps">III</span>.) wrote a letter to the
Pope in favour of him.”</p></div>

<p>Speaking of Ardern’s manuscripts, he
<span class="nowrap">observes—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These manuscripts, though they are more ludicrous than luminous,
are extremely well worth the attention of the surgical antiquary,
from the numerous illustrations they contain of the mode and
manner in which Ardern performed his operations; which, considering
that he was an <em class="italic">improver</em> of surgery, gives us a glorious
notion of what the art was previously to John’s refinements, or
those of Roger Franks, whom he mentions with great praise.”</p></div>

<p class="center">“<span class="allcaps">ANATOMICAL</span> <span class="allcaps">LECTURES</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When Dr. Hunter began his anatomical lectures, they were
given in the evening—but as he lived at the period when Garrick
was in his zenith, he soon discovered that he stood no chance with
the actor, for whenever Garrick <em class="italic">lectured</em>, the <em class="italic">anatomical lectures</em>
were neglected. In vain did the Doctor preach to the pupils on
the immorality of attending theatres, and the impropriety of neglecting
him; it was of no avail; Romeo’s apothecary and Dr. Last
were the only medical characters to spend the evening with, and
for the rest, they thought Macbeth sufficient authority, to ‘throw
physic to the dogs.’
<span class="xxpn" id="p337">[p337]</span></p>

<p>“For this reason, and for this reason alone, the anatomical
lectures were afterwards given in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>“Dr. Hunter may be considered as the father of the anatomical
schools of London, and he bequeathed a fame and character to his
class, which has been supported with undiminished lustre to the
present day. Previously to his time, very little had been done;
Cheselden had given a few lectures—so had André, and Nourse;
and Dr. Frank Nicholls gave what he considered a systematic
course, and published a Syllabus of thirty-nine lectures. Dr. Maclauren
and Dr. Marshal were also anatomical teachers. To the
late Mr. Cline, however, and to Mr. Abernethy, we are indebted
for the anatomical schools at two of our largest hospitals.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cline, it is true, found a place to lecture in, but it was
his great talents and his high character, that brought it into
notice, and subsequently, with Sir Astley Cooper, made it one of
the first schools in Europe.</p>

<p>“To Abernethy is due the sole honour of establishing the
Anatomical School at St. Bartholomew’s, now second to none;
and it is to the advantages arising from the hospital education of
the metropolis, that London has become, within the last half century,
the most distinguished seat of medical tuition in the world.
Long may it flourish!</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="allcaps">APOTHECARY</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Apothecary, in its derivative sense, does not seem to allude
particularly to the sellers of medicines. Αποθηκη is of very indefinite
signification, (<em class="italic">Horreum</em>,) a market, shop, or repository,
which may be used or applied to any other business. Chaucer and
Pegge make it <em class="italic">Poticarry</em>, while some have derived it from <em class="italic">A-pot-he-carries</em>,
intimating, that they used to carry the medicines themselves,
as well as see them administered. ‘Give me an ounce of
civet, good apothecary,’ says Shakspeare.</p>

<p>“The ancient apothecaries were called <span class="allcaps">ΡΙΖΟΤΟΜΟΙ</span>, root-cutters;
and root-cutters they may still be considered; at any
rate, no one will deny to honest, herborizing Tom Wheeler, the
character of a primitive <span class="allcaps">ΡΙΖΟΤΟΜΟΣ</span>.</p>

<p>“That they may still be characterised by this appellation, their
‘herborizing walks,’ and their botanic garden at Chelsea, afford
very creditable proofs; nor is there any circumstance in the
history of the present worshipful society, that reflects more honour
on their zeal in promoting those branches of science, which appertain
to their avocation, than the disinterestedness and liberality
with which, during the last two centuries, they have maintained
their establishment at Chelsea.</p>

<p>“An active and intelligent member of their court has furnished
them with a very interesting and ample memoir on the subject,
<span class="xxpn" id="p338">[p338]</span>
by which it appears, that this expensive design was commenced at
a time when the society was without any disposable funds, when
their hall was burnt down in the memorable fire, and when they
were obliged to draw upon their own private pecuniary resources,
to enable them to enter on an undertaking, ‘whose principal
design was honourable reputation, without any prospect of worldly
advantage.’</p>

<p>“Previously to the establishment of this garden, there had been
nothing of the kind, with the exception of a few private gardens,
the most conspicuous of which were those of the celebrated John
Gerarde, and the elder Tradescant; the former of these not then
being in existence, and the latter in a state of neglect and ruin;
and the locality of their position is now only known from the
records of the times.</p>

<p>“There was, however, besides these, a small garden in Westminster,
belonging to Mrs. Gape, the plants from which furnished
the first specimens for the Chelsea Garden. It appears from
Evelyn’s journal, that he paid old Mrs. Gape’s <em class="italic">medical garden</em> a
visit in June 1658; whether he begged, borrowed, or bought any
plants, does not appear; that he had a very fine garden at Sayer’s
Court, is well known; but that he lent it to that royal barbarian,
Peter the Great, when he was studying ship-building at Deptford,
is, perhaps, not so generally known, nor, moreover, the return
this royal carpenter made to Evelyn’s politeness, or the manner in
which he showed his horticultural taste, in being wheeled through
his landlord’s ornamental hedges, and over his borders, in a
wheel-barrow; a circumstance which is recorded in a letter to the
then Secretary of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>“In France, the apothecaries were incorporated so early as
1484; but it was not till the reign of King James the First,
when the metropolis abounded in dangerous empirics, who made
and compounded many ‘hurtful, false, and pernicious medicines,’
that the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries were incorporated in
London. Notwithstanding a charter was given them to correct
these abuses, it was found to be nugatory with respect to those
who were not members of the society; and, although they made
repeated applications to parliament, it is only within these very
few years that their powers have been extended, and that they
could legally enter the shop of any ‘person or persons using the
art and mystery of an apothecary, in any part of England and
Wales, for the purpose of searching, surveying, and proving
whether the medicines, wares, drugs, or any thing or things
whatsoever, in such shop or shops contained, and belonging to the
art or mystery of an apothecary, be wholesome, meet, and fit for
the cure, health, and ease of His Majesty’s subjects.’”

<p>“So says an old song, in an old play, and so said Dr. Ralph
Thorius, and the learned Dr. Everard, who wrote a book, entitled
‘Panacea, or a Universal Medicine, being a Discovery of the
wonderful Virtues of Tobacco’ (1659); and in the frontispiece of
his book, the Doctor is represented with a pipe in his mouth.
Dr. William Butler, styled, by Fuller, the Æsculapius of his age,
was also a great admirer of tobacco, and that he might not smoke
a dry pipe, he invented a medical drink, called ‘Butler’s Ale;’
afterwards sold at the Butler’s Head, in Mason’s-alley, Basinghall-street.</p>

<p>“Sir Theodore Mayerne gives a curious specimen of his
tobacco practice: ‘A person applying to him with a violent
defluxion on his teeth, Butler told him, that ‘a hard knot must be
split with a hard wedge,’ and directed him to smoke tobacco
without intermission, till he had consumed an ounce of the herb.
The man was accustomed to smoke; he therefore took twenty-five
pipes at a sitting. This first occasioned extreme sickness,
and then a flux of saliva, which, with gradual abatement of the
pain, ran off to the quantity of two quarts. The disorder was
entirely cured, and did not return for seventeen years.’</p>

<p>“Ant. Wood says, that he was much resorted to, ‘and had
been more, did he not delight to please himself with fantastical
humours.’</p>

<p>“Many singular stories are related of him, perhaps they are
travelling stories, as may be conjectured, from the nature of the
prescription, when he ordered a lethargic parson to be put into
the warm carcase of a newly-killed cow!</p>

<p>“Fuller paints this humorist in striking colours, but observes,
‘that he made his humorsomeness to become him; wherein some
of his profession have rather aped than imitated him, who had
morositatem æquabilem, and kept the tenor of the same surliness
to all persons.’</p>

<p>“The following extracts from <em class="italic">Letters from the Bodleian</em>, vol. ii.,
will give a notion of his <em class="italic">humour</em>, and of his mode of treating his
patients.</p>

<p>“‘Dr. Gale, of St. Paul’s schoole, assures me that a Frenchman
came one time from London to Cambridge, purposely to see him,
whom he made stay two houres for him in his gallery, and then he
came out in an old blue gowne. The French gentleman makes
him two or three very low bowes downe to the ground; Dr. Butler
whippes his legge over his head, and away goes into his chamber,
and did not speake with him. He kept an old mayd, whose name
<span class="xxpn" id="p340">[p340]</span>
was Nell. Dr. Butler would many times goe to the taverne, but
drinke by himselfe: about nine or ten at night, old Nell comes to
him with a candle and lanthorne, and sayes, “Come home, you
drunken beast.” By and by Nell would stumble, then her master
calls her “drunken beast;” and so they did “drunken beast” one
another all the way till they came home.’</p>

<p>“‘The Dr. lyeing at the Savoy in London, next the water side,
where was a balcony look’t into the Thames, a patient came to
him that was grievously tormented with an Ague. The Dr.
orders a boate to be in readinesse under his windowe, and discoursed
with the patient (a gent.) in the balcony, when, on a
signal given, two or three lusty fellows came behind the gent.,
and threw him a matter of twenty feet into the Thames. This
surprise absolutely cured him.’</p>

<p>“‘A gent. with a red, ugly, pimpled face, came to him for a
cure. Said the Dr. “I must hang you.” So presently he had a
device made ready to hang him from a beam in the roome; and
when he was e’en almost dead, he cuts the veins that fed these
pimples, and lett out the black ugly blood, and cured him.’</p>

<p>“Butler must have been a man of abilities, for the Lord Treasurer
Burleigh wrote to the President of the College of Physicians,
desiring that Butler might be allowed to practice in London
occasionally, and he was consulted, with Sir Theodore Mayerne
and others, in the sickness that proved fatal to Prince Henry;
and it is reported that Butler, at first sight of him, gave an unfavorable
prognostic. The account of this case affords such an
excellent notion of the consultations and practise of the doctors
of those days, that I am induced to give it as stated in the ‘Desiderata
Curiosa.’</p></div>

Dr. Mayerne, and the favorers thereof, alledging that in this case
of extremity, they must (if they meant to save his life) proceed in
the cure, as though he was some meane person.</p>

<p>“‘This was not agreed to, and next day, the Physicians, Chirurgeons,

Shortly after it was announced that all hope was gone. His
Majestie then gave leave and absolute power to Dr. Mayerne, to

Doctor did not it seems like this, “for hee, weighing the greatness

<p>“No part of surgery is supposed to be so easy to understand
as <em class="italic">bone-setting</em>; it is regarded by a considerable part of the people
as no matter of science, an affair on a level with farriery, as
easily learnt, and like a heritage, to be transmitted from father
to son; in short, the pretensions of these people are very like
those of the man who set up as an oculist, <em class="italic">because</em> he had <em class="italic">lost an

<p>“We are not without plenty of ignorant and impudent pretenders
at the present day, but the celebrated Mrs. Mapp, the
bone-setter of Epsom, surpasses them all. She was the daughter
of a man named Wallis, a bone-setter at Hindon, in Wiltshire,
and sister to the celebrated ‘Polly Peachem,’ who married the
Duke of Bolton. Upon some <em class="italic">family quarrel</em>, Sally Wallis left her
professional parent, and wandered up and down the country in a
miserable manner, calling herself ‘Crazy Sally,’ and pursuing,
in her perambulations, a course that fairly justified the title.
Arriving at last at Epsom, she succeeded in humbugging the
worthy bumpkins of that place so decidedly, that a subscription
was set on foot to keep her among them; but her fame extending
to the metropolis, the dupes of London, a numerous class then as
well as now, thought it no trouble to go ten miles to see the conjuror,
till at length, she was pleased to bless the afflicted of
London with her presence, and once a week drove to the Grecian
Coffee-house, in a coach and six, with out-riders! and all the
appearance of nobility. It was in one of these journeys, passing
through Kent-street, in the Borough, that being taken for a certain
woman of quality from the Electorate in Germany, a great
mob followed, and bestowed on her many bitter reproaches, till
Madame, perceiving some mistake, looked out of the window, and
accosted them in this gentle manner: ‘D—— n your bloods, don’t
you know me? I am Mrs. Mapp, the <em class="italic">bone-setter</em>!’ upon which,
they instantly changed their revilings into loud huzzas.</p>

<p>“That she was likely enough to express herself in these terms,
<span class="xxpn" id="p342">[p342]</span>
seems very natural from her origin and history; but that she
should be on visiting terms with decent people, and keep quality
company, is as unnatural. Mr. Pott, who wrote with the pen of
a master, has noticed this in no very gracious terms:—‘We all
remember,’ says he, ‘that even the absurdities and impracticability
of her own promises and engagements, were by no means
equal to the expectations and credulity of those who ran after
her; that is, of all ranks and degrees of people, from the lowest
labourer or mechanic, up to those of the most exalted rank and
station; several of whom not only did not hesitate to believe
implicitly the most extravagant assertions of an ignorant, illiberal,
drunken, female savage, but even solicited her company;
at least, seemed to enjoy her company.’”</p></div>

the wonderful effects of tar water,’ says he, ‘reveal its
excellencies to others. I say reveal, because they are beyond
what any can conceive by reason or natural light. But others
disbelieve them, though the revelation is attested past all scruple,
because to them such strange excellencies are incomprehensible.
Now give me leave to say, that this infidelity may possibly be
as fatal to morbid bodies, as other infidelity to morbid souls. I
say this in honest zeal for your welfare. I am confident, if you

<p class="center">“<span class="allcaps">BUTTER</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. John Whitehurst (author of an ingenious theory of the
earth) was the means of Dr. William Butter’s settling at Derby,
where he (Mr. W.) then resided. Mr. Whitehurst had met at
Buxton with Lord Hopetown, who had asked him what physicians
were at Derby, and upon his telling him, that there could not be
a finer opening, as the two physicians there had both declined
practice, his Lordship said it would be a good place for Butter;
and shortly afterwards, the Doctor made his appearance loaded
with recommendations, and among others, with one from Dr. Hope
<span class="xxpn" id="p343">[p343]</span>
to Mr. Whitehurst. Mr. W. was very civil to him, but before he
had been a fortnight in the town, Butter came and complained,
that he had not had a single patient. Mr. W. told him, that he
could hardly expect any so soon, that he must be known a little,
and so on, which so offended Butter, that ever afterwards he considered
Mr. W. as his enemy. He was very rude and coarse in
his manner, always averse to consultations, and used to say, that
nobody but himself and Sir John Pringle knew any thing of physic.
Among his patients at Derby were two brothers, opulent men,
who lived together; one of them being dangerously ill, and attended
by Butter, the other brother sent a messenger to Birmingham
for two physicians, and then told Butter what he had done,
and that he intended to have a consultation. Butter immediately
went to the apothecary, and got some laudanum, of which he gave
large doses to the patient, so that when the Birmingham physicians
came, the patient was in a state of lethargy. They asked
if he had been taking opium, but Butter denied that any had
been given; it was accidentally discovered, however, by means
of the apothecary, and from that time Butter, who was before in
excellent practice, lost considerably in public estimation.</p>

<p>“A tailor at Derby, whom Butter had offended, once played
him a trick. A curer of smoky chimnies came to Derby, and one
day, when the tailor knew the Doctor was out of town, he called
on the chimney-man, and told him that Butter had desired to have
a smoky chimney cured, belonging to his best parlour; and had
left positive orders that he should go to his house and set about
it immediately. The operator accordingly went, delivered his
message to Butter’s servant, pulled out his utensils, and fell to
work; and in a short time the marble slab, and other ornaments
of the chimney, were down. Butter came in while he was engaged
in this business; finding his parlour full of bricks and dirt
and mortar, his fury was excessive, and his hatred to the tailor
was ever after implacable. The story got wind in the town, and
the boys in the street would sometimes talk about <em class="italic">chimney-doctors</em>
as he passed.</p>

<p>“Butter lived close to a churchyard, and one day, seeing a
grave-digger at work, he asked him for whom he was digging the
grave—‘For so and so,’ said the grave-digger, naming the tailor
who had so highly offended him, which so pleased the Doctor, that
he gave the fellow a shilling. This occasioned a fresh laugh at
his expense, as the tailor was in good health, and it was merely a
piece of pleasantry of the grave-digger’s. Butter and his wife
lived in the most frugal manner, and never visited anybody. After
he came to London, a lady of fortune, who had been his patient in
Derbyshire, and wished to countenance him, invited him often to
her table, till at length Butter brought in an account of fees for
each visit.”

me with a call.’ Dr. Martyn, the professor of Botany at Cambridge,
supped with him in Newgate the night previous to his
expected execution. Blair had been all along confident that he
should be reprieved: Dr. Martyn said, he sat pretty quietly till
the clock struck nine, and then he got up and walked about the
room; at ten he quickened his pace; and at twelve, no reprieve
coming, he cried out—‘By my troth! this is carrying the jest too
far!’ The reprieve, however, came soon after, and in due time a
pardon. Blair went afterwards, and settled at Boston in Lincolnshire,

<p>“Dr. Joseph Adams, who was much with Woodville just before
his death, used to relate several traits of his firmness and seeming
unconcern with respect to death. Woodville lived in lodgings
at a carpenter’s in Ely-place, and Adams, a few days before his
death, advised the matron of the Small-pox Hospital to invite him
to have a bed made up there, that he might be better attended to:
this she did, and Woodville accepted it. He observed to Adams,
the next day, that he was a poor man come to die at the hospital,
and he remarked, that some of those who called on him flattered
him with hopes of his getting better. ‘But I am not so silly,’ he
said, ‘as to mind what they say; I know my own case too well,
and that I am dying. A younger man with better stamina might
think it hard to die; but why should I regret leaving such a
diseased, worn-out carcase as mine?’</p>

<p>“The carpenter with whom he lodged had not been always
on the best terms with him; Woodville said he should wish to
<span class="xxpn" id="p346">[p346]</span>
let the man see that he died in peace with him, and as he never
had much occasion to employ him, desired he might be sent for to
come and measure him for his coffin. This was done; the carpenter
came, and took measure of the Doctor, who begged him not
to be more than two days about it; ‘For,’ said he, ‘I shall not
live beyond that time;’ and he did actually die just before the
end of the next day. He got between one and two thousand
pounds by his Medical Botany, and with the money bought a small
estate, which he left to his natural daughter, being all the property
he possessed.”</p></div>

<p>We happen to know this fact, and moreover, that the
Doctor was playing at chess when the carpenter was introduced

<h3><em class="italic">On Tic Douloureux</em>. <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">S<span>IR</span></span>,</p>

<p><span class="smcaps">P<span>RESUMING</span></span> that popular and domestic medicine may occasionally
find a niche in your Journal, I beg to offer a few
remarks upon the above complaint, which has lately become,
as it would appear at least, singularly prevalent; and as I
address myself to general readers, I shall avoid all learned
terms of art, and minute descriptions requiring them. The
genuine tic douloureux is usually considered as a morbid
affection of the nerves of the face, very commonly attacking
the circumference of the orbit, and producing frequent and
violent paroxysms of excruciating pain; the disease, however,
varies considerably in intensity, and sometimes bears the
same name when attacking other parts; it frequently occurs
under the integuments of the head, and may or may not be
attended with external tenderness. Though opiates relieve the
pain, they are ineffectual as to its cure. Peruvian bark, in
<span class="xxpn" id="p347">[p347]</span>
various forms, has sometimes afforded relief, and preparations
containing the metallic tonics, more especially the oxides of
iron, have been regarded as giving more permanent and
beneficial assistance. Local remedies are of very uncertain
utility, and electricity and galvanism have generally done more
harm than good. The division of the nerves has been resorted
to, but never with permanent, and often not even with temporary
benefit. The cause of the disease is unknown, and
though sometimes organic derangement would appear to
excite it, no plausible source of the mischief can usually be
discovered. The patient’s principal solace is that the disorder
frequently wears itself out, and as far as my experience goes,
the less we rely upon individual remedies, the better—the main
thing being strict attention to the general health, and especially
to the state of the stomach and bowels. These remarks apply
to the genuine Tic Douloureux; but it has of late years been
the fashion in physic to give that alarming name to a variety
of painful affections, resulting from very various causes, by
which much needless uneasiness has been given to the patient,
and which has often led to erroneous and even mischievous
systems of practical treatment. As cases of this kind are of
every day occurrence, a short notice of them can scarcely be
inappropriate to a Journal, the chief object of which is to
familiarize every branch of science.</p>

<p>Rheumatic affections of the head and face often put on the
appearance of Tic; like it, they come on at short intervals,
and are limited to a small space; there is, generally, more or
less of external tenderness, sometimes confined to spots upon
the face and scalp, not larger than a shilling; at others, more
diffused. More or less of this is usually attendant upon habits
subject to chronic rheumatism, and it not uncommonly is the
leading feature of the complaint. The internal use of opiates
and sudorifics, especially small doses of Dover’s powder,
warm fomentations, and keeping the head, especially at
night, wrapped up in flannel, are sovereign remedies.</p>

<p>But the most common cases of painful affections, mistaken
for Tic, are those which occur in nervous and irritable persons,
and especially amongst men of business, statesmen, lawyers,
merchants, over-studious persons, and all whose minds are
<span class="xxpn" id="p348">[p348]</span>
occasionally exercised beyond their powers, who are subject
to reverses of fortune, or sudden changes in the posture of
their affairs, and who are constant objects of public attention,
praise, or censure. For a time, the constitution, if a good one,
bears up against such wear and tear, but as you advance, one
or other symptom of a shattered nervous system appears,
and this, more quickly and certainly, where the body has
been pampered by too good living, false spirits excited by
indulgence in wine, and fatigue relieved by narcotics, instead
of sleep. Among the host of disordered affections to which
such persons are liable, violent local nervous pains are most
common, but they are invariably relieved by such means as
contribute to quiet the mind and invigorate the body. Abstinence
from business, retirement into the country, regular
hours, plain food, moderate exercise, and avoiding excitement,
are here certain remedies, and indeed the only ones, but they
are unfortunately not always easy of attainment, and sometimes
altogether unattainable. I have, however, mentioned
these cases, to enjoin an early attention to the overhanging
evil, and to criticise its improper treatment. I would, upon
the first point, enjoin early attention to the first symptoms, and
when they appear let the individual seriously ask himself
whether it be worth while to gain a little more money, glory,
or honour, or renown, at the expense of all future comfort,
and a painful, wearisome, and probably shortened existence;
or whether such apparent advantages had not better be at
once conceded, and the host of evils, which will almost certainly
ensue, warded off by a timely retirement? I could
illustrate this subject by reference to many individuals, especially
in the legal and medical professions, some of whom are
harassing themselves to death by over-exertion, whilst others
(I regret to say but few) are preserving a healthy constitution,
by sacrificing a certain share of fame and emolument: the
exceeding folly, too, of persevering in business, when neither
mental nor bodily powers are adequate to the exertion, might
here be animadverted on, but I must, for the present, waive
such topics, and return to the treatment of those nervous pains
called Tic Douloureux, which are of such common occurrence
in the cases alluded to. These will certainly give way under
<span class="xxpn" id="p349">[p349]</span>
that quiet and retirement which has been above recommended;
but it is really provoking to see such means so commonly neglected,
and the unfortunate patients tormented by blisters,
fomentations, and galvanism, and their already debilitated
stomachs further overpowered by gigantic doses of powdered
bark, rust of iron, and other (in such cases) equally ineffective
and hurtful medicines. I write to warn against them.</p>

<p>I have spoken of Peruvian bark as a remedy in tic douloureux.
Where the painful affection so called, let it arise from
what cause it may, assumes an intermitting form,—and nothing
is more common than to have it coming on at stated periods,
generally one violent attack in the twenty-four hours,—in such,
as in other similar cases, bark has often been effective; but of
late, sulphate of quinine has very properly been substituted for
it; and as this extremely curious and valuable medicine is
now in every one’s hands, and even finding its way into family
medicine chests, a few words respecting its use, or rather
abuse, may not be here misplaced. I would first remark, that
it is too commonly given in over-doses: it then produces
thirst, and a white tongue, and, what is remarkable, it excites
in most people that uneasy sensation of fulness about the
stomach, which is generally complained of after a large dose
of powdered bark, and ascribed to the indigestible nature of
the large quantity of inert and insoluble woody fibre in which
that substance abounds. For these reasons sulphate of quinine
is too often laid aside in cases where, if properly and
judiciously administered, it might prove of important service;
instead of three or four grains, or even more, repeated every
four or six hours, let a grain be given once a day; and if
it agree, and occasion require, let this dose be repeated twice
or thrice daily, either in the form of pill or solution. I prefer
the latter; two drachms of tincture of orange-peel being used
as the solvent, and diluted afterwards with half a wine-glass of
water. It is not meant here to insinuate, that in obstinate
agues, and other disorders, large doses of quinine are always
improper, but to enforce the occasional mischief which they
produce, and by which the medicine is unjustly brought into
distrust and disrepute.</p>

<p>Decayed teeth are fertile sources of pains and twitches
<span class="xxpn" id="p350">[p350]</span>
about the facial nerves and muscles, analogous to Tic; and
great irritation from inflamed membranes of some cavity in
the upper jaw has also occasioned them. I knew a person
who suffered six months from such an attack, and for whom a
physician prescribed, in the course of that period, some pounds
of carbonate of iron. Symptoms then ensued, for which a
course of sarsaparilla was ordered, but it was of no avail.
Mercurials were then given, with manifest mischief. The extraction
of the second grinder effected a permanent cure; its
roots were connected with a cavity of fetid discharge, which
had no sooner vent, than all the symptoms disappeared.</p>

<p>Without exceeding the limits which I have set myself, I
cannot proceed farther in these remarks; but I hope enough
has been said to quiet the apprehensions of some invalids who
suffer themselves to be exceedingly alarmed at the name given
to their complaint, and to be dosed with large quantities of
useless medicines, which rather aggravate than relieve it. In
many of these cases, the less that is done the better; in all of
them, careful reference must be had to the real exciting cause;
and, in addition to the other circumstances adverted to, a strict
attention to diet must be enforced, and more than ordinary
watchfulness exerted over the state of the stomach and
bowels: plain roast and boiled, and no grease or piecrust in
the former; and for the latter, an occasional blue pill and a
tea spoonful of Epsom salt.</p>

<h3><em class="italic">Remarks on some Quadrupeds supposed by
Naturalists to be extinct</em>. By John Ranking, Esq. <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">T<span>HERE</span></span>
 is not any part of the creation more interesting to
mankind than the gigantic classes of quadrupeds. In them,
we are able to contemplate the power of the Creator of all
things, in one of the most magnificent exercises of his will.
Such, however, is the limit to this kind of knowledge, that there
is probably not any one class, even of the largest quadrupeds,
all the <em class="italic">species</em> of which are, or possibly ever can be,
known to the student of natural history. More than half of
<span class="xxpn" id="p351">[p351]</span>
the surface of the earth is still undiscovered by the civilised
portion of its inhabitants: regions as extensive as Europe, in
Asia, Africa, and America, are, at this time, either wholly unknown
or undescribed.</p>

<p>The imperfection of history is such, that the most civilised
ancient states of the world have left little behind but what
may be called fragments of their annals. If we include the
Gothic age, as it is called, from the fifth to the fifteenth century,
there are not less, out of the fifty-eight centuries which
the earth is said to have existed, than forty of them which may
be termed a blank, as far as regards profane and natural
knowledge.</p>

<p>The period assigned to the Deluge is seventeen centuries
after the creation, or upwards of four thousand years past.
There are not any known real historical annals that can contest
this event, and the natural state of the earth offers abundant
proofs of its reality. Under all these considerations, the fossil
remains of elephants and other large quadrupeds, known to
have been employed or slain by the Romans and Moguls, may
justly be considered as independent of any relation to that
catastrophe, and in no wise concerned in the discussion. Established
truths are rather disturbed and weakened by arguments
which are open to refutation.</p>

<p>The time is not distant when it will be generally acknowledged
that all those kinds of quadrupeds, the remains of
which have been found at the very places mentioned in history,
are still in existence; a fact which, when proved, will be of
infinitely greater interest as it regards so grand a portion of
nature, than the single supposition that they are all extinct,
because we are not acquainted with the exact species which
corresponds with many of the fossil kinds frequently discovered:
this being the foundation on which such a conclusion is principally
built.</p>

<p>Naturalists have endeavoured to prove that such bones are
found where they could only have been placed by the Deluge:
but the changes in the surface from deposits by rivers, earthquakes,
and imperceptible alterations from the accretion of
vegetable matter, and from dust, volcanoes, digging of mines,
wells, canals, foundations, and other disturbances of the soil,
<span class="xxpn" id="p352">[p352]</span>
are such as cannot be observed or registered; and a few lines
will prove how difficult and uncertain this part of the question
remains to this day.</p>

<p>“In quarrying limestone at Aix, in Provence, A.D. 1788,
under eleven strata, separated from each other by a bed of
sand and clay, at the depth of forty-five feet, the surface was
covered with shells. The stones of this bed being removed,
under a stratum of argillaceous sand, stumps of columns and
fragments of stones, like the quarry, half wrought, were found;
and also coins, handles of hammers, and a board, one inch
thick and seven feet long, broken, but all the pieces there, and
could be joined; it was like the boards used by quarry-men,
and worn in the same manner. The pieces of wood were
changed into <em class="italic">agate</em><a id="fnanchor_53_17" href="#fn_53_17" class="fnanchor">53</a>.”</p>

<p>“On sinking a well on a hill near Tobolsk, sixty-four
<em class="italic">fathoms</em> deep in the earth, an oaken beam was found; it was
quite black, and not round but shaped<a id="fnanchor_54_18" href="#fn_54_18" class="fnanchor">54</a>.”</p>

<p>“At Watlington-park, Oxfordshire, at fifty or sixty feet
depth, many whole oaks, hazel-nuts, a stag’s-head and antlers,
were found, and on the same spot two Roman urns<a id="fnanchor_55_19" href="#fn_55_19" class="fnanchor">55</a>.”</p>

<p>“In Oxfordshire there is a tumulus which has become a
perfect mount of stone.”</p>

<p>“Ralph, the brother of Earl Widdrington, showed me many
<em class="italic">human</em> bones taken from whole skeletons, with British beads,
chains, iron rings, and brass bits of bridles, dug up in a
<em class="italic">quarry</em> at Blankney, Lincolnshire, which was probably plain
mould when these old corpses of the Britons were interred:
and I Saw many <em class="italic">human</em> bones and armour, with Roman coins,
fibluæ &#38;c., found in a <em class="italic">stone</em>-pit in Hunstanton-park, Norfolk,
belonging to Sir Nicholas L’Estrange<a id="fnanchor_56_20" href="#fn_56_20" class="fnanchor">56</a>.”</p>

<p>Very numerous instances could be added, in order to prove
that the local circumstances, when skeletons of these quadrupeds
are found, are not of a nature to disprove the <em class="italic">historical</em>
origin of fossil bones. From the highest authority we learn,
that the “bones of species which are apparently the same with
<span class="xxpn" id="p353">[p353]</span>
those that still exist alive, are never found except in the latest
alluvial depositions, or in the fissures of caverns and rocks, in
places where they may have been overwhelmed by debris, or
even buried by man<a id="fnanchor_57_21" href="#fn_57_21" class="fnanchor">57</a>.”</p>

<p>Thus it appears that a comparative view of the exact <em class="italic">species</em>
now living, with that of the fossil remains, is what we must
depend on to decide whether the fossil kinds may not be still in
existence.</p>

<p>With respect to the very numerous theories of the earth, the
last, by Werner, has been confidently quoted in opposition to
the writer’s historical proofs<a id="fnanchor_58_22" href="#fn_58_22" class="fnanchor">58</a>. But Werner himself, before his
death (in 1817), tacitly acknowledged that it is not a tenable
doctrine, and which is clearly indicated by the compilers of
<span class="smcaps">R<span>EES</span></span>’s <em class="italic">Cyclopedia</em><a id="fnanchor_59_23" href="#fn_59_23" class="fnanchor">59</a>, although it is generally allowed to be the
best extant. This hypothesis was formed on a circumscribed
view of the strata in Saxony, but it is found to be quite inapplicable,
in America for instance<a id="fnanchor_60_24" href="#fn_60_24" class="fnanchor">60</a>. To account for fossil bones
of elephants, &#38;c., being found high in the north, the American
author who discovered this defect in the geological doctrine,
conjectures that those large quadrupeds may have migrated,
like the buffalos, during the change of seasons. This notion,
however, would not apply to Asia, the native countries of those
animals being well supplied with leaves or other food the year
round.</p>

<p>With these prefatory remarks some historical proofs are
offered, for the probability of the following animals found in a
fossil state, not being of extinct species, beginning with the</p>

<h4><span class="smcaps">E<span>LEPHANT</span></span>.</h4>

<p>“On sinking the foundation for a mill, near the side of a
small brook in the Bishop of Kilmore’s lands, at Maghery,
<span class="xxpn" id="p354">[p354]</span>
eight miles from Belturbet, in the
north of Ireland,
<span class="smmaj">A.D</span>. 1715, four large
teeth were found, with a piece of the
under jawbone and part of the skull
of a young elephant. The teeth were
more solid and petrified than when
in a natural state.”</p>

<p>Fig. A is one of the above grinders.
B is a fossil grinder in the possession
of the Royal Society. C is the
grinder of an elephant between 10
and 11 feet high, the entire skull of which was then in Westminster<a id="fnanchor_61_25" href="#fn_61_25" class="fnanchor">61</a>.</p>

<div class="figc-s1">
<img src="images/i354e.jpg" width="600" height="410" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is thus apparent that two <em class="italic">fossil</em> elephants are of the same
species as those now in existence.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that the Maghery animal was conveyed
to Ireland as a present, or for exhibition. “Fiacra, son of
Eacha Moymedon, was mortally wounded at the battle of
Caonry, which was fought
<span class="smmaj">A.D</span>. 380, wherein he was victorious
against the army of Momonia, (Munster). On his return to
Hy-mac-uais, in <em class="italic">Meath</em>, he died of his wounds. His funeral
<span class="xxpn" id="p355">[p355]</span>
leacht was erected, and on his tomb was inscribed his name in
the Ogham character<a id="fnanchor_62_26" href="#fn_62_26" class="fnanchor">62</a>.”</p>

<p>We here find that the native sovereign of the northern part
of Ireland resided in Meath, the borders of which county are
not many miles from the place where the elephant was found.
It was at about the year of the battle of Caonry that Maximus,
the emperor in Britain, aspired to be master of the
Roman empire. Finding the union of the Scots and Picts
prevented his peaceable possession of Britain, which was a
great obstacle to the execution of his project, he persuaded
the Picts to join their forces to his, on the promise of giving
them the lands of the Scots. The Scots were thus overpowered,
and were forced to fly to Ireland and the adjacent isles.
The Scots, being assisted by the Irish, invaded the north, and
were driven back to Ireland by Maximus, at the head of his
troops. The emperor threatened to invade Ireland, and punish
the Irish; but the dread they had of the presence of a Roman
army, induced them to grant Maximus his own terms, which,
in order to conciliate all parties, were moderate<a id="fnanchor_63_27" href="#fn_63_27" class="fnanchor">63</a>. Now it is
by no means impossible that the British emperor, on this conciliating
occasion, sent this very elephant to his Irish majesty.
Tacitus observes, that Agricola (three centuries before Maximus)
received an expelled petty king of Ireland into his protection;
that in manners the natives vary little from the
Britons; and that <em class="italic">the ports and landings of Ireland are better
known, through the frequency of commerce and merchants,
than those of Britain</em><a id="fnanchor_64_28" href="#fn_64_28" class="fnanchor">64</a>.</p>

<p>This quadruped is now known not to differ from the elephant,
except in the form of the grinders, and has probably been
called by the name of elephant by the Romans. Remains of
the mastodon have been found mixed with those of the elephant,
in Europe, Siberia, and America; and for the following
<span class="xxpn" id="p356">[p356]</span>
reasons there is every probability of this animal being in existence.</p>

<p>Captain C. S. Cochrane, in his <em class="italic">Journal in Colombia</em>, vol. ii.,
p. 390, relates that numbers of the <em class="italic">carnivorous</em> elephants have
been seen feeding on the plains at the foot of a ridge of mountains,
at Choco, in New Granada. “Part of the foot of a
mastodon, with five nails attached, was found in a cave, with a
tooth, by a savage west of the Missouri: it was very fresh, and
perfectly resembling that of an elephant: it was obtained of a
Mexican, who had purchased it of a native<a id="fnanchor_65_29" href="#fn_65_29" class="fnanchor">65</a>.”</p>

<p>“The native Americans describe the elephant as still existing
in the northern parts of their country (the Missouri).”—Mr.
Jefferson’s <em class="italic">Notes on Virginia</em>, p. 57.</p>

<p>Many bones of the mastodon were found in the county of
Wythe, Virginia, with a mass of half-ground branches, roots,
and leaves, enclosed in a kind of sack, supposed to be the
stomach, in the midst of them; so as to leave no doubt that
they were substances which the animal had devoured, and
among them were distinguishable the remains of some plants
known in Virginia<a id="fnanchor_66_30" href="#fn_66_30" class="fnanchor">66</a>. Teeth of the mastodon have been found
in Little Tartary, (for five centuries possessed by the Moguls,)
in Siberia, near the Oural mountains, and one at Harwich,
in England<a id="fnanchor_67_31" href="#fn_67_31" class="fnanchor">67</a>.</p>

<p>There, have been brought from Ava, found on the left bank
of the Irawaddy, in N. lat. 20° to 21°, near the wells of petroleum,
in narrow ravines, sand-hills, beds of gravel, ironstone,
and calcareous breccia, evidently a <em class="italic">diluvial</em> formation,—fossil
bones, shells, and wood. Bones of the mastodon, equal in size
to those of the Ohio, a grinder
<span class="mixfract">16<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
inches in circumference, a
humerus, measuring 25 inches round the condyles, with several
<span class="xxpn" id="p357">[p357]</span>
grinders and bones of younger individuals, and fragments of
tusks: fossil molares of the rhinoceros, resembling two species
of a genus named by Cuvier Anthracotherium: bones like an
animal of the horse kind: remains of crocodiles, supposed to
be the gavial, or long-nosed alligator of the Ganges, (not now
known in the rivers of Ava.) The fossil bones were upon or
near the surface, more or less exposed, not decomposed or
rolled, and are of animals that died there. The bones are
petrified, and deeply coloured with iron, the substance siliceous
and very hard. The blocks of wood are larger than the trees
growing there, but it is not known if they are of the same
kind. “An idle notion is entertained by many, that these
fossil remains have been generated by a petrifying quality in
the water of the Irawaddy<a id="fnanchor_68_32" href="#fn_68_32" class="fnanchor">68</a>, but I think they are the result, as
elsewhere, of one of the last catastrophes; in fact, the remains
of a former world, before man was called into existence.”—<em class="italic">Morning
Herald</em>, Sept. 14, 1827.</p>

<p>Bones of the mastodon have been found in Europe, mixed
with menagerie collections, which cannot possibly be attributed
to any other origin than that of sports of the amphitheatre.
They are found in western Siberia, which was conquered by
Sheibani, Genghis Khan’s grandson,
<span class="smmaj">A.D</span>. 1242, and held 300
years, and whose first capital was at Tiumin<a id="fnanchor_69_33" href="#fn_69_33" class="fnanchor">69</a>, on the river
Tura, near the Ural mountains, where the remains of the mastodon
were found. Ava was conquered by the Grand Khan
Kublai in 1272, in a battle with the king of eastern Bengal,
in which there were a thousand elephants<a id="fnanchor_70_34" href="#fn_70_34" class="fnanchor">70</a>. The places where
they have been found in America correspond with history and
tradition so faithfully, as to assist the other numerous proofs of
Mexico and Peru having been conquered by the Moguls, in
the year 1283, and the bones of the mastodon are there
found, as well as remains of <em class="italic">elephants, precisely like those of
Siberia</em><a id="fnanchor_71_35" href="#fn_71_35" class="fnanchor">71</a>. With regard to the tooth found at Harwich, the
<span class="xxpn" id="p358">[p358]</span>
British kings Cuneboline<a id="fnanchor_72_36" href="#fn_72_36" class="fnanchor">72</a> and Arviragus had representations
of elephants on their coins. The bones of elephants, rhinoceroses,
and crocodiles found in Ava are not, as those found in
Europe and Siberia, what are termed <em class="italic">extraneous</em> fossils; the
same kinds of animals being natives of the spot in Ava. The
one like the horse cannot be ascertained; but the kings of
Pegu, in former times, had camelopards, and, therefore, probably,
zebras in their <em class="italic">calichars</em>, or parks; they also had <em class="italic">unicorns</em>,
ostriches, and rein-deer<a id="fnanchor_73_37" href="#fn_73_37" class="fnanchor">73</a>. Timur Khan, grandson of
Kublai, who invaded Siberia with such powerful armies, resided
at Tali, in Yunan, N. lat. 25° east of the Irawaddy<a id="fnanchor_74_38" href="#fn_74_38" class="fnanchor">74</a>.</p>

<p>The writer is of opinion that all those fossil bones found in
Ava are of species still in existence: they may have floated
down from more northern parts, the river in question being as
long as the Ganges, said to be navigable into China; and has
its source in Thibet,—(see
<span class="smcaps">R<span>ENNELL</span></span>’s <em class="italic">Memoir</em>, p. 217.) According
to the hypothesis of the writer, Montezuma’s ancestor
was a Mongul grandee from Assam; and mastodontes’ remains
have been found in Mexico, and those beasts are, as above
related, supposed to be found alive near the Missouri.</p>

<p>This is the first instance the writer has met with of similar
bones not being <em class="italic">extraneous</em>; and is, therefore, a remarkable
fact, which excites the strongest suspicion that their species
are still living. Ava is a new world on a small scale, and this
collection of bones will, very probably, at no distant date, lead
to positive proof of the existence of other quadrupeds, now
conjectured by naturalists to be extinct. With respect to the
local position, it is in all probability the old bed of the river, as
<span class="xxpn" id="p359">[p359]</span>
the beds of those in Asia change in a wonderful manner.—(See
<em class="italic">Rennell</em>, p. 255.)</p>

<p>A skeleton of an elephant or mastodon, for it is not known
which, was found in a tomb in Mexico, which had evidently
been built on purpose.—(<em class="italic">Clavigero</em>, vol. i., p. 84.) No authority
whatever dates the foundation of Mexico earlier than
<span class="smmaj">A.D</span>.
1324. The Aztecs advanced from Culiacan, when they took
possession of the marshes, and founded Mexico: other Aztecs
had preceded them who had arrived by land; but the writer
hazarded a theory<a id="fnanchor_75_39" href="#fn_75_39" class="fnanchor">75</a> that <em class="italic">Montezuma’s</em> ancestors had, like those
of the Natchez and of the Incas, arrived in America by <em class="italic">sea</em>
with elephants, under Mango Capac; and he has had the satisfaction
to find a confirmation of his conjectures in a <em class="italic">decade</em>
written by Peter Martyr, the Milanese, (employed by Ferdinand
V., King of Castile and Arragon, and who died in the
year 1526,) addressed to Adrian <span class="allcaps">VI</span>., who had been co-regent
of Spain with Cardinal Ximenes. “Montezuma spoke thus
to Cortez:—We have heard by our ancestors that we are
strangers. A certain great prince, in <em class="italic">ships</em>, before the memory
of all men living, brought our ancestors unto these coasts;
whether voluntarily or driven by tempest it is not manifest;
who, leaving his companions, departed into his country, and,
at length returning, would have had them to have gone back
again. But they had built houses, and joining themselves
with the women of the country had begotten children, and
had settled. Wherefore our ancestors, having chosen a senate
and princes to govern the people, refused to go, and he departed
with threatening speeches. Never any appeared unto
this time who denied the right of that captain and commander.
We think, therefore, that the king who sent you derived his
descent from him, and all the kingdoms which we possess are
yours<a id="fnanchor_76_40" href="#fn_76_40" class="fnanchor">76</a>.” It is impossible to know clearly what the allusions
to the return of the great commander may mean, but whatever
it be, it does not change the date. As the Mexicans considered
Cortez to be a child of the sun, the <em class="italic">great prince</em> must
have been a descendant from Genghis Khan; and <em class="italic">thence</em> the
<span class="xxpn" id="p360">[p360]</span>
terrors and submission of Montezuma and the Mexicans, who
had always dreaded such a visit.</p>

<p>The Aztecs had sojourned in Culiacan and other places, from
the date of the arrival of the ships, till they proceeded to Anahuac.
The foundation of Tenochtitlan (or Mexico) having been
in 1324, and the first king, Montezuma’s ancestor, elected in
1377; therefore, the empire, when Montezuma died, had lasted
only 144 years; and this calculation is from the most authentic
documents known, that is, the pictures in Purchas’s collection.
In Harris’s <em class="italic">Voyages</em>, vol. ii., p. 97, Montezuma is said to have
told Cortez, that it was only a century since they had been
settled where they were, meaning, probably, that it was not <em class="italic">two</em>
centuries.</p>

<p>Thus an elephant being found in a tomb in Mexico, and
others in tombs in Siberia, is an additional argument to the
strong ones already produced, for the Mexicans being the
Moguls blown from the shores of Japan,
<span class="smmaj">A.D</span>. 1283, which
appears irresistible; and also that mammoths and mastodontes
are not extinct, being found either living or fossil in all the
places in America, which agree with the traditions on that
subject, and with the histories of China and Japan<a id="fnanchor_77_41" href="#fn_77_41" class="fnanchor">77</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcaps">T<span>HE</span></span>
<span class="smcaps">T<span>APIR</span></span>.
</h4>

<p>The Tapir was supposed to be peculiar to the New World:
two fossil species, one of them gigantic, have been found in
<span class="xxpn" id="p361">[p361]</span>
France, Germany; and Italy<a id="fnanchor_78_42" href="#fn_78_42" class="fnanchor">78</a>. The remains of a tapir being
found at Florence, with those of other quadrupeds usually
exhibited by the Romans, was an unaccountable fact, till it
was known, through Sir Stamford Raffles, that the tapir exists
in Sumatra. We know that the Romans carried on a commerce
with India, which employed <em class="italic">one hundred and twenty
ships annually</em>, and that they had the power of being supplied
with all the animals of those regions, by means of country
ships, which traded to the ports of Musiris and Barace, those
which the Romans frequented. Moreover, the author of the
<em class="italic">Periplus</em>, p. 36, describes <em class="italic">Sumatra</em>. It appears, therefore,
evident that the Romans procured tapirs from that island, if
they be not inhabitants of Africa. The British king, father of
Caractacus, had a tapir on one of his numerous coins<a id="fnanchor_79_43" href="#fn_79_43" class="fnanchor">79</a>; which
may be reckoned among many other proofs that the ancient
Britons were not quite so ignorant and barbarous as is generally,
but unjustly, imagined. The discovery of this tapir shows
how little is yet known even of those countries in which Britain
has, for a length of years, had establishments. The tapir is
probably what the natives have reported as a <em class="italic">river-horse</em>, a
much more appropriate name for it than for the African beast.
“The descriptions of the hippopotamus,” says Baron Cuvier,
“by Herodotus and Aristotle, are supposed to have been borrowed
from Hecatæus of Miletus, and must have been taken
from two very different animals, one of which is the true hippopotamus,
and the other the <em class="italic">antelope gnu</em> of Gmelin<a id="fnanchor_80_44" href="#fn_80_44" class="fnanchor">80</a>.”
Now, as it appears that the Indians described by Herodotus
by the name <em class="italic">Padæi</em>, is an exact account of the <em class="italic">Batta</em> in Sumatra,—(Dr.
Leyden thinks them the same word, as the Indo-Chinese
pronounce B as P<a id="fnanchor_81_45" href="#fn_81_45" class="fnanchor">81</a>,)—it is rendered probable that that
island was known to the Greeks, long before the Romans possessed
Egypt. On these grounds, I venture a conjecture that
Aristotle and Herodotus alluded to the tapir, which is <em class="italic">amphibious</em>,
but the gnu is not. The tapir is probably the <em class="italic">küda-ayer</em>
of Sumatra, and the <em class="italic">conda-aijeer</em>, or <em class="italic">river paard</em>, of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p362">[p362]</span>
Javans.—(See
<span class="smcaps">M<span>ARSDEN</span></span>’s <em class="italic">Sumatra</em>, third edition.) With
respect to the <em class="italic">gigantic</em> tapir, it is as probable that those regions
(apparently less known to moderns, as regards zoology, than to
the Greeks and Romans) may contain gigantic tapirs as ouranoutangs,
near eight feet high, so lately discovered.</p>

<h4>
<span class="smcaps">U<span>NICORN</span></span>.
</h4>

<p>Many reasons have been given, in another place<a id="fnanchor_82_46" href="#fn_82_46" class="fnanchor">82</a>, to prove
the probability of the existence of the unicorn, since which the
following description of two has been met with.</p>

<p>“On the other part of the temple of Mecca are parks or
places enclosed, where are seen two unicorns: they are shown
to the people as a miracle; and not without good reason, for
their rareness and strange nature. One of them, which is
much higher than the other, is not much unlike a colt of thirty
months of age: in the forehead groweth one horn, in manner
right forth, of the length of three cubits. The other is only
one year of age, and like a young colt: the horn of this is of
the length of four handfuls. This beast is of that colour of a
horse called weasel, and hath a head like a hart, but not a
long neck, and a thin mane, hanging on one side. Their legs
are thin and slender, like a fawn or hind: the hoofs of the
fore feet are divided in two, much like the feet of a goat: the
outer part of the hinder feet is very full of hair. This beast
seemeth wild or fierce, yet tempereth that fierceness with a
certain comeliness. These unicorns were given to the Sultan
of Mecca as a most precious and rare gift. They were sent
him out of Ethiopia by a king of that country, who was
desirous by such a present to gratify the Sultan<a id="fnanchor_83_47" href="#fn_83_47" class="fnanchor">83</a>.”</p>

<p>So lately as the year 1799, a Mahomedan African prince is
said to have sent two of them to Mecca.—(<span class="smcaps">R<span>EES</span></span>’s <em class="italic">Cyclopedia</em>,
“Monoceros.”) Bell of Antermony describes one which was
killed in Siberia, near the <em class="italic">Irtish</em>, in 1713. Tamerlane slew
unicorns and rhinoceroses on the frontier of <em class="italic">Cashmere</em>, (<em class="italic">Sherefeddin</em>,
b. 4., ch. xxx.) and there have recently been <em class="italic">reports</em> of
unicorns in <em class="italic">Nepaul</em>, which are rendered more probable to be
<span class="xxpn" id="p363">[p363]</span>
the truth, by those references of Mr. Bell and Sherefeddin to
countries not very distant.</p>

<p>The British king Cuneboline had also the unicorn on his
coins, and the figure of the animal is very similar to the above
description<a id="fnanchor_84_48" href="#fn_84_48" class="fnanchor">84</a>. The writer is, therefore, of opinion that these
now described are the real oryx mentioned by Aristotle, Pliny,
and other ancient authors<a id="fnanchor_85_49" href="#fn_85_49" class="fnanchor">85</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcaps">H<span>IPPOPOTAMUS</span></span>.
</h4>

<p>The remains of this beast have been found in England at
the residences of the Romans, <em class="italic">viz.</em>, near London, Colchester,
and York; and not any in Ireland or Scotland. They have
also been found in Italy mixed with great numbers of the
bones of other beasts known to have been exhibited by the
Romans. This animal is not known to inhabit any country
but Africa. Two were caught near Damietta,
<span class="smmaj">A.D</span>. 1600.
They are known to inhabit Abyssinia, Bornou, the Cape of
Good Hope, Senegal, and they were met with in great abundance
by the two vessels, the Sion, of 200 tons, and St. John,
of 50 tons, which sailed above nine hundred miles up the river
Gambia,
<span class="smmaj">A.D</span>. 1620, employed by Sir Wm. St. John<a id="fnanchor_86_50" href="#fn_86_50" class="fnanchor">86</a>. The
inference is, that they inhabit the whole of that vast continent,
and that it is most probable the number of species is as great
as that of elephants; and that the fossil kinds not having been
brought from the same country as the living individuals with
which they have been compared, has induced naturalists to
suppose them extinct. An elaborately grand Roman
<span class="xxpn" id="p364">[p364]</span>
pavement was dug up at Roxby, in Lincolnshire, upon which is
represented Orpheus, surrounded by an elephant, lion, boar,
dog, wolf, stag, and another, which appears to be the hippopotamus<a id="fnanchor_87_51" href="#fn_87_51" class="fnanchor">87</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcaps">T<span>URTLE</span></span>.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<span class="smcaps">T<span>ORTOISE</span></span>.</h4>

<p>“A beautiful fossil sea-turtle has recently been discovered,
and, by the perfect substitution of all the organic parts as well
as its locality, may be considered an interesting remain of a
former world. It is encrusted in a mass of ferruginous limestone,
and weighs 180 lbs. The spot on which it was found is
in four fathoms of water, and is formed of an extensive
stratum of stones, called the Stone Ridge, about four miles
off Harwich harbour; and is considered to be the line of conjunction
between the opposite cliffs of Walton and Harwich.
It is in the possession of Mr. Deck, of
Cambridge<a id="fnanchor_88_52" href="#fn_88_52" class="fnanchor">88</a>.”</p>

<p>A fossil turtle was found near Harwich, embedded in a solid
block of cement-stone; another large stone, when broken, was
found to contain “nearly the whole of a <em class="italic">human</em> skeleton<a id="fnanchor_89_53" href="#fn_89_53" class="fnanchor">89</a>.”</p>

<p>Fossil sea-tortoises have been found in the environs of
Brussels, in the environs of Maestricht, at the village of Melsbroeck
and in the mountain of St. Peter, in the state of Glaris
and in the vicinity of Aix; they differ in species from any of
those at present known<a id="fnanchor_90_54" href="#fn_90_54" class="fnanchor">90</a>.</p>

<p>There is not any of the extraneous fossil remains more probably
of Roman origin than tortoises. “The beds, the doors,
and pillars of the houses of the Greeks and Romans, were
decorated with tortoise-shell. In the reign of Augustus, this
species of luxury was at, its height in Rome<a id="fnanchor_91_55" href="#fn_91_55" class="fnanchor">91</a>. Bruce says, the
Egyptians dealt very largely with the Romans in this elegant
article of commerce; Martial relates that beds were inlaid with
it; Velleius Paterculus observes, that when Alexandria was
taken by Julius Cæsar, the magazines were so full of this
article, that he at first proposed to make it the principal ornament
of his triumph; as he used ivory afterwards when triumphing
for his African victories<a id="fnanchor_92_56" href="#fn_92_56" class="fnanchor">92</a>.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p365">[p365]</span></p>

<p>Cuneboline and his son Arviragus having had the elephant,
tapir, and unicorn on their coins; and as the first was brought
up at the court of Augustus<a id="fnanchor_93_57" href="#fn_93_57" class="fnanchor">93</a>, there is every probability of
their having possessed tortoises at Harwich, the port of the
capital of the British king.</p>

<h4><span class="smcaps">S<span>PECIES</span></span>.
</h4>

<p>With regard to elephants, the number of species appears to
be very great, even with the extremely limited knowledge we
possess. The writer saw three distinct kinds captured in one
keddah at Tippera, when he was there during Mr. Corse’s
residence at that place, and who has described them. Some
African females have tusks as large as the males, but it is not
known to be so in Asia. Le Vaillant mentions a race of
elephants which never have tusks. Two Ceylon elephants
were found to differ in the shape of the jaws, and another is
mentioned by Baron Cuvier, which is dissimilar to any that
had been seen<a id="fnanchor_94_58" href="#fn_94_58" class="fnanchor">94</a>.</p>

<p>The Camelopard now at Paris differs in many essential
anatomical characters from the kind at the Cape of Good
Hope<a id="fnanchor_95_59" href="#fn_95_59" class="fnanchor">95</a>.</p>

<p>The Romans and Moguls crossed the species and genera of
different animals. The crocotta was between a dog and a
wolf; the crocuta, between a hyæna and a lioness<a id="fnanchor_96_60" href="#fn_96_60" class="fnanchor">96</a>. The
Moguls cross the breed of dogs with leopards, the best of
which are those of Hezereh and Tesheen in Cabulistan; and
some are so brave that they will attack a lion<a id="fnanchor_97_61" href="#fn_97_61" class="fnanchor">97</a>. Four towns
near Babylon were exempted from any other tax than the
maintaining of dogs which were supposed to be produced
between the tiger and bitch<a id="fnanchor_98_62" href="#fn_98_62" class="fnanchor">98</a>. We thus may perceive how
impossible it is to be certain of a fossil species being extinct
because we are not acquainted with it.
<span class="xxpn" id="p366">[p366]</span></p>

<p>Ptolemy Philadelphus, in a procession at Alexandria, had
twenty-four thousand Indian dogs, a camelopard, a white
bear, and twenty-four chariots drawn by elephants, twelve by
lions, seven by oryxes, eight by ostriches, four by wild asses,
and five by buffaloes<a id="fnanchor_99_63" href="#fn_99_63" class="fnanchor">99</a>. Bajazet, in the fourteenth century,
had twelve thousand dog-keepers. The immensity of wild beasts
slaughtered by the Persians, Moguls, and Romans, would
be incredible, were it not attested by so many different authorities;
and with regard to the Romans, no author mentions a
less number than five thousand of every description slain at the
opening of the Coliseum. These sports having been in vogue
all over the Roman empire for so many centuries, the fossil
bones which have been found are but few indeed. In Britain
there were at least five amphitheatres; at Sandwich, Dorchester,
Silchester, Caerleon, York<a id="fnanchor_100_64" href="#fn_100_64" class="fnanchor">100</a>. In France, at Paris,
Cahors<a id="fnanchor_101_65" href="#fn_101_65" class="fnanchor">101</a>, Vienne, Arles, Orange, Autun, Treves, Nismes,
Poitou<a id="fnanchor_102_66" href="#fn_102_66" class="fnanchor">102</a>, and Bordeaux. In Spain, at Seville, Tarragona,
Merida, and Saguntum. In Italy a great number. The popularity
of monarchs and statesmen depended on their power to
indulge the people with these cruel sports. Commodus is said
to have been one of the most dexterous marksmen: he always
had with him Parthians, to teach him archery, and Moors, to
perfect him in throwing the dart. He ran with all horned
animals, except bulls, and smote them unerringly as he pursued.
Lions, panthers, and other fierce beasts, he ran after in
the Peridrome, and darted at them from above with never-failing
effect, whether he aimed at the forehead or the heart.
With arrows, pointed like a half-moon, he would cut off the
heads of the Mauritanian ostriches, while their wings were
<span class="xxpn" id="p367">[p367]</span>
expanded to aid their speed, and they continued their course
for a time without their heads. He would expose a prize-fighter
to the attack of a panther, and strike the beast dead
before it could fasten its teeth on the man. A hundred lions
have been sent out of the dens, and all killed by him with
such certainty, that they lay close together, not a dart failing<a id="fnanchor_103_67" href="#fn_103_67" class="fnanchor">103</a>.</p>

<p>Domitian had been equally notorious in these grand sports
in the Amphitheatre.</p>

<p>Had the fossil animals died, or been killed by natural accidents,
the skeletons would generally have been found entire,
but for the most part they are scattered and broken, and are
often mixed with bones of animals resembling the species of
the present time<a id="fnanchor_107_71" href="#fn_107_71" class="fnanchor">107</a>. In the vicinity of Orleans in France, a
<em class="italic">fossil</em> roe, of a living species, was found in <em class="italic">limestone</em>, along
with the bones of the <em class="italic">palæotherium</em>.</p>

<p>Instances have occurred of bones being found, in great
numbers; and, many feet deeper, other heaps of bones of elephants
and wild beasts; but as many amphitheatres were built
<span class="xxpn" id="p368">[p368]</span>
with wood, and as the games were exhibited for about six
centuries, those structures would require to be often renewed,
and the old bones would thus be covered over with earth.
Britain was invaded or visited by about twenty emperors, or
those so high in importance as to become emperors of Rome;
and York was the head-quarters of the Roman empire during
the residence in Britain of Severus and his two sons and co-emperors,
Geta and Caracalla<a id="fnanchor_108_72" href="#fn_108_72" class="fnanchor">108</a>. All the <em class="italic">collections</em> of fossil
bones are found at the head-quarters of the Romans, or near
the several amphitheatres in the island. Bones of elephants
which have been found in France and Italy in fifteen places,
are so faithfully accurate to the road over which Hannibal
and Asdrubal with fifty-two elephants marched<a id="fnanchor_109_73" href="#fn_109_73" class="fnanchor">109</a>, and <em class="italic">Hannibal’s
(thirty-seven) all perished before his arrival at Thrasymene</em>,
that no theory whatever can stand in competition with
such historical conviction<a id="fnanchor_110_74" href="#fn_110_74" class="fnanchor">110</a>. If the bones found on Hannibal’s
road be not those of his Getulian elephants, are we to conclude
that the remains of the beasts lost two thousand years ago have
totally perished; but that other bones of elephants, many
thousands of years older, have been preserved upon the same
spot, although some of them are found quite near the surface?
At Plaine de Grenelle, a fossil elephant was dug up, and at
that place there stood a Roman amphitheatre<a id="fnanchor_111_75" href="#fn_111_75" class="fnanchor">111</a>. The great
numbers of elephants then used in warfare may be judged of,
by Metellus having captured upwards of a hundred in the
battle of Palermo, where many besides had been killed<a id="fnanchor_112_76" href="#fn_112_76" class="fnanchor">112</a>; and
accordingly fossil bones have been found, there and also at
Syracuse, where there was an amphitheatre. In Spain, thirty-nine
elephants were slain at Munda, in the battle fought between
the two Scipios and Asdrubal. At the bridge of Manzanares,
and at Toledo, fossil remains of elephants have been
<span class="xxpn" id="p369">[p369]</span>
dug up; and at these very places Hannibal and Asdrubal
defeated one hundred thousand Carpetani, many of whom were
trodden to death by their forty elephants<a id="fnanchor_113_77" href="#fn_113_77" class="fnanchor">113</a>.</p>

<p>If we glance at the sports of the Mongols, what a treasure
for an osteologist might be found at Termed in Sogdiana,
where the army commanded in person by Genghis Khan were
four months occupied in enclosing an immense circle, till all
the wild beasts were driven (without one escaping, under pain
of death to the soldier who failed in his duty, but who was
not allowed to kill the tigers, lions, &#38;c.) into a spacious plain,
where they were slaughtered by the Grand Khan and all the
Imperial princes and military commanders, till they chose to
permit the soldiers to end the destruction<a id="fnanchor_114_78" href="#fn_114_78" class="fnanchor">114</a>. How many fossil
<em class="italic">species</em> might be discovered there, of which naturalists have no
knowledge! The Persians are said to have slaughtered as many
as fourteen thousand beasts on a like expedition<a id="fnanchor_115_79" href="#fn_115_79" class="fnanchor">115</a>. So long
have these amusements existed, that Hushing, king of Persia,
B. C. 865, <em class="italic">bred dogs and leopards</em> for hunting<a id="fnanchor_116_80" href="#fn_116_80" class="fnanchor">116</a>.</p>

<p>Besides the fossil remains which have been found of numerous
quadrupeds, named by the Romans in their sports, they employed
the following, bones of which have not been detected:—Indian
dogs, white bears, camels (one found), dromedaries,
camelopards, wild asses, zebras, quaggas, oryxes (unicorns),
Ethiopian sheep, Arabian sheep, the crocotta (bred from a dog
and wolf), crocuta (from a hyæna and lioness), little dragons,
ostriches. The gnu was known to the Romans; and probably
the nyl-ghau and the om-kergay (quite harmless, and the size
of a rhinoceros). In this list several of the fossil kinds described
as the ancient wild beast with a thick skin (palæotherium),
and the beast without weapons, or unarmed (anoplotherium),
may be found, and also those of the genus canis, and a carnivorous
beast<a id="fnanchor_117_81" href="#fn_117_81" class="fnanchor">117</a>.</p>

<p>Such is a short notice of this most extensive subject, to which
the writer’s attention has been attracted by the concurrence of
<span class="xxpn" id="p370">[p370]</span>
historical relations with the locality of fossil remains. It is
offered for the consideration of the reader, not in a spirit of
controversy, but with a desire to ascertain an important truth
in natural history, whether his speculations be confirmed or
refuted. Whichever way a decision is awarded, it will add to
the interest attached to zoological pursuits, and the reader will
be, by these remarks, enabled to form a judgment whether the
laborious and ingenious works which have been published, since
the conviction that elephants are not human giants, (a notion
seriously maintained so recently as in Clavegero’s <em class="italic">History of
Mexico</em>, written since that of Robertson) are descriptions of the
quadrupeds of a <em class="italic">former world</em>, or of the world which is now in
<em class="italic">existence</em>. <em class="italic">It is necessary to remark that these particular researches
relate only to animals connected with Roman and
Mogul history</em>; and if it should be conceded that it may justly
be inferred, that quadrupeds hitherto deemed extinct are still
to be found in the undiscovered parts of Africa, Asia, and America,
not half of either region being yet scientifically known, it
will give an interest to zoology and osteology ten fold more
attractive than a blank and unsatisfactory hypothesis of their
having all perished <em class="italic">before the creation of man</em>, as is often
alleged. It is perhaps the most remarkable circumstance in literature,
that naturalists so rarely allude to the astonishing number
of beasts slain in the Roman games, although the list of them
is, generally speaking, so similar to that of the fossil remains.
Erroneous notions concerning fossil bones, those of elephants,
in particular, being the most plentiful, began in very early ages
when they were considered to be human; and James the First
(of Britain) sent Lord Herbert of Cherbury to Gloucester, to
ascertain if a skeleton, dug up at that place, was really that of
a giant. There were found mingled with it horns and bones of
oxen and sheep, and the tusks of a boar. Lord Herbert,
Dr. Clayton, and the celebrated Harvey, thought the bones
were those of one of the Roman elephants; and Bishop Hakewill
received a letter from my lord of Gloucester, mentioning
that “he was <em class="italic">not confident</em> that the grinder was the tooth of a
man<a id="fnanchor_118_82" href="#fn_118_82" class="fnanchor">118</a>.” This discovery, perhaps, put an end in England to
the notion of giants’ bones.
<span class="xxpn" id="p371">[p371]</span></p>

<p>The next fanciful origin was, that these fossil remains were
those of an extinct monster, called Mammoth by the native
Siberians, their name for the walrus; but which was transferred
and confounded with the bones of whales, elephants, and
buffalos, found in that country, and such erroneous opinions
will long be entertained in those quarters.</p>

<p>The diluvian origin was imagined by many to be the true
one, but later careful examinations proving that the animals
died on the spot where they are found broken, and the bones
scattered about, that hypothesis could not in such instances be
maintained, and recourse was had to the supposition, that Britain
was in former ages a tropical country; but the mixed fossil
remains, being those both of hot and cold climates, and of
beasts peculiar only to Africa, or to Asia, this theory appears to
be quite as objectionable as the others. The last, and the most
specious, of all the hypothetical proofs of the origin is, that
the teeth not often corresponding with those of the living
specimens which have been seen, they must be the remains of
extinct quadrupeds. There are, perhaps, fifty large regions
where elephants abound, and the teeth of <em class="italic">very few indeed</em> of
the animals of those countries have yet been seen. This last
appears to be, defective as it is, the strongest objection that can
be urged against the historical origin; and the few remarks in
this essay will contribute materially to weaken this remaining
hypothesis. The reader who feels any interest in zoology will,
by their means, be assisted in his endeavours to untie or cut this
gordian knot. After he has decided either that these beasts are
in existence, or all extinct.</p>

Conquest of Peru, ch. x. It is somewhat curious that,
when Pyrrhus for the first time brought elephants into Italy, the
Romans gave them the name of Lucanian bulls; and that the Americans
call them
big bulls in their traditions. It is probable that
both people compared them with the largest beast known to them; as
elephants, if indigenous in america before the arrival of Mango Capac
and Montezuma’s ancestor, would have been extremely numerous, and
have had a proper name.</p>

A Roman coin is said to have been discovered recently among the
Indians in America, which has justly created surprise; but others have
been found long ago. Bishop Hakewill’s book is dated
<span class="smmaj">A.D</span>. 1635: he
says, “Marianus Siculus, in his history of Spain, reports that certain
coined pieces of gold, engraved with the image and inscription of
Augustus Cæsar, were found in the American mines; thereby inferring
that those countries were <em class="italic">then</em> discovered.” p. 310. Batou, the cousin
of Kublai, both grandsons of Genghis, had conquered Russia, ravaged
Europe to the Adriatic, and died on his march to Constantinople, in
1256. His successor also ravaged as far as Constantinople, (P. de la
Croix, p. 387.) Mango (so spelt by Du Halde, ii., 251, and Maundeville,
p. 275; Manku by Tooke, Russ. Emp., ii., 13) was brother to
Kublai, who is considered by the writer to be the father of the first
Inca, and there is nothing more probable than that he and other Moguls
on the Japanese expedition may have possessed Roman coins, the plunder
of Hungary, Poland, Dalmatia, and the Greek empire, as far as the
capital.</p>

See Cuvier’s Theory of the Earth, p. 80. Wars and
Sports, p. 335. With regard to the unicorn, Camper has remarked, that
“if this animal was ruminant and cloven-footed, it is certain that
its frontal bone must have been divided longitudinally into two, and
that it could not possibly have had a horn placed upon the suture.”
This remark by Camper, when we consider how nature adapts every thing
to its purposes, cannot stand as a real objection to the existence
of the oryx. The most eminent naturalists have been wrong in some
of their conjectures. John Hunter pronounced the mastodon to be a
carnivorous beast. Buffon, after frequently considering the bones of
the mammoth, conceived them to belong to a beast six times larger
than the biggest elephant; and Muller was of opinion that it must
have been 105 feet in height, and 133 in length! So little capable is
any human being to judge what nature does, or can do!</p>

<h3 class="hleft"><em class="italic">Description of a cheap and
portable Instrument for enabling Young People to acquire a knowledge
of the Stars, or determine their situation in the Heavens</em>. By S.
Lee, Esq. <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">T<span>HERE</span></span>
is no science, the study of which tends so much to enlarge
the mind as Astronomy. It opens to our view the grandest
examples of Almighty power, wisdom, and beneficence—the
<span class="xxpn" id="p372">[p372]</span>
contemplation of which fills the soul with reverence and affection
for the great Author of nature, and banishes all narrow
and superstitious notions respecting him.</p>

<p>The cultivation of this science, therefore, cannot be too
strongly recommended to the attention of young people. The
eager curiosity and avidity for discovery which so peculiarly
distinguish that period of life, when the reasoning faculties
begin to develope, is peculiarly fitted for its reception—and,
accordingly, amongst the better-educated classes of society,
the elements of this science are generally considered as a necessary
branch of instruction—though commonly limited to a
mere <em class="italic">dogmatic</em> explanation of the Copernican system, and the
use of the globes.</p>

<p>But this superficial mode of instruction, though sufficient to
enable any one to understand the real motions of our planetary
system, and explain the apparent motions which must result
from them, is hardly sufficient to satisfy inquisitive reasoning
minds, since it leaves them ignorant of the means by which the
distances, magnitudes, and orbits of the planets and comets
were first discovered; and how, if lost, a knowledge of them
might be recovered from observations alone.</p>

<p>The most pleasing methods of instruction will generally be
found the most efficient. It is impossible for any one who has
had the least experience in teaching not to have perceived,
that one practical application of science makes a deeper and
more lasting impression on the mind of a learner than a
thousand theoretic propositions.</p>

<p>An accurate knowledge of the fixed stars is the first step
to practical astronomy; it is, in fact, the alphabet of the
science. By the rising, southing, and setting of these bodies,
astronomers are enabled correctly to measure time; and from
their apparent altitudes, to determine the latitude of places on
the surface of the globe, whilst the permanent situations which
they maintain with respect to one another, furnish them with
so many marks by which to trace the course of the sun, moon,
and planets through the heavens. Such were the data which
enabled Copernicus and Newton to unravel the seeming irregularity
of their apparent paths, and explain the beautiful simplicity
of their real motions.</p>

<p>The instruments usually had recourse to for this purpose
<span class="xxpn" id="p373">[p373]</span>
are, celestial globes, planispheres, and atlases, but none of
these afford such ready and certain means of finding or identifying
particular fixed stars, as at first might be expected from
them.</p>

<p>The Globe possesses the great advantage of being easily rectified
to the place of observation and adjusted to the exact
hour of the night. It likewise exhibits all the stars in their
proper situations of altitude and azimuth;—but the constellations
being delineated on a convex surface, and viewed from
without, whilst the heavens appear to us a concave viewed
from within, the groups of stars are seen reversed, a circumstance
which, occasions no small degree of perplexity to a
learner.</p>

<p>Planispheres and atlases exhibit the constellations as they
appear to the eye when on the meridian, but in a position very
different from that which they assume when removed far from it.
In short, except the pleiades and a few remarkable groups, it
is difficult to recognise a constellation in every position, without
great practice and continued observation.</p>

<p>The Equatorial furnishes the best and readiest means of discovering
or identifying any particular star, but the great price
of this instrument, and the complicated nature of its adjustments,
render it unfit for learners.</p>

<p>The instrument which we are about to describe, is in its
principle the same as the Equatorial, though not pretending to
any thing like the same degree of accuracy; but it has this
advantage over it,—its adjustments are more simple and obvious,
consequently, better adapted to the capacity of learners;
and it can be afforded at a very moderate expense, the price
not exceeding that of a common globe.</p>

<p>A, B, C, D, is the stand of the instrument, composed of
three triangular pieces of wood glewed together, so that the
plane of the upper piece, D B C, makes with that of the lower
piece, A B C, an angle equal to the co-latitude of the place
it is intended for.</p>

<p>On the upper piece, D B C, is described a circle, E F G, the
circumference of which is divided into twenty-four hours, and
every hour into twelve parts, equal to five minutes each.</p>

<p>From the centre of this circle, and perpendicular to the
<span class="xxpn" id="p374">[p374]</span>
plane on which it is described, rises a pillar, the top of which
appears at H above the cone I, which can be made to revolve
upon it as an axis.—On the surface of the cone is delineated
the principal stars visible in England, and the lower edge is
divided into 365 parts, representing the days of the year.</p>

<div id="figc-p374">
<img src="images/i374.jpg" width="550" height="800" alt="" />
</div>

<p>On the top of the pillar is fitted a segment of a circle, K, of
<span class="xxpn" id="p375">[p375]</span>
about 140°: viz. 90° of north, and 40° of south declination,
which may be made to revolve upon the pillar as an axis independently
of the cone. To this part is attached the scale, L,
divided into degrees of north and south declination, corresponding
to those on the semicircle,—and so contrived as in
every situation to touch lightly the surface of the cone.</p>

<p>To the declination circle K is attached the alidade M, which
may be set to any degree required, and serves as an index to
direct the eye of the observer to any object, which may be
viewed along the edge of it, or through the small holes in the
sights O P.</p>

<p>Having described the several parts of the instrument, it only
remains to shew the use of it; which will be best explained by
means of a few problems.</p>

<h4 class="hleft"><span class="smcaps">P<span>ROBLEM</span></span> 1. To adjust the instrument.</h4>

<p>The instrument being made for the place of observation, need
only to be placed on a perfectly horizontal stand, and with the
line joining the hours <span class="allcaps">XII</span> and <span class="allcaps">XII</span> on the circle, in the direction
of the meridian: the former of these adjustments may be verified
by means of a small level applied to the stand at N, in the
directions B C and A N successively. If found incorrect in
either position, let a piece of card be put under that foot
(A, B, or C) from which the bubble is found to recede, and
let this operation be repeated until the bubble rests in the
middle, in both positions.</p>

<p>The instrument may be brought into the meridian by the
assistance of a magnetic needle fixed to the frame at N, or on
the opposite side, or more correctly by means of the sun, provided
the time be exactly known,
<span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

<p>Set the index M to the sun’s declination, turn the circle K
round its axis, till the scale L points to the hour and minute
on the circle E F G. Then if the instrument be correctly
placed, the sun will be seen through the sights O, P, or what is
the same thing, the light admitted at the hole O will fall on
the hole P. If not, the instrument must be turned about till
this effect is produced.</p>

<p>The instrument being once carefully adjusted to the meridian
on any immoveable stand, such as the sill of a window,
<span class="xxpn" id="p376">[p376]</span>
the top of a post, &#38;c., lines may be drawn on the stand in the
direction of the sides A B, A C, or B C, by means of which it
may at any time be replaced with little trouble.</p>

<h4 class="hleft"><span class="smcaps">P<span>ROBLEM</span></span> 2. The instrument being correctly placed and
levelled, the next operation will be to adjust the conical
projection to the day and hour of observation.</h4>

<p>Turn the cone round till the day of the month on the circle,
at the bottom of it, coincides with the hour and minute on the
circle E F G.</p>

<p>Example.—To adjust the cone for the 15th January, at
twenty minutes past nine at night. Turn the cone till the
15th January on the circle attached to it coincides with <span class="allcaps">IX</span> h.
20 m. P. M. on the circle E F G.</p>

<h4 class="hleft"><span class="smcaps">P<span>ROBLEM</span></span> 3. The cone being adjusted, and any star proposed,
to find its place in the heavens.</h4>

<p>The cone remaining at rest, turn the declination segment K
till the scale L cuts the proposed star on the projection; note
its declination on the scale and set the index M to the same
degree on the segment K, when the index will point to the
star, which, if the adjustments have all been correctly made,
will be seen through the sights P, O.</p>

<p>Example.—To find the star Aldebaran; look for Aldebaran
on the projection, bring the scale L to cut it, and you will find
it against 16° north declination. Set index M to 16° N. P., and
look along the edge of it, or through the holes P, O, and you
will see the star.</p>

<h4 class="hleft"><span class="smcaps">P<span>ROBLEM</span></span>
4. Having observed a star in the heavens, to find
it on the projection.</h4>

<p>Set the cone as accurately as you can to the day and hour,
then turn the declination segment round, and elevate the index
till you can see the star through the sights P, O. Note the
declination at the segment K, cut by the index M, and against
the corresponding degree of the scale you will find the star on
the projection.</p>

<p>If no such star can be found, you may then conclude that
it is a planet, or a new star.</p>

<p>By this means the place of the moon, of a planet, or a
comet, may be noted down, from time to time, and their apparent
paths traced out.
<span class="xxpn" id="p377">[p377]</span></p>

<h4 class="hleft"><span class="smcaps">P<span>ROBLEM</span></span> 5.
To find the hour of the day by the sun.</h4>

<p>Turn the segment K, and elevate the index M, till the sun
is seen or shines through the sights O, P, and the scale L
point to the hour and minute on the circle E F G.</p>

<h4 class="hleft"><span class="smcaps">P<span>ROBLEM</span></span> 6.
To find the hour of the night by means of a
star.</h4>

<p>Direct the index M to the star, so as to be seen through
the sights P, O; then laying hold of the scale L, to keep it in
that position, turn the cone till the star on the projection is cut
by the scale, when the day of the month on the circle at the
bottom of the cone will coincide with the hour and minute
on the circle E F G.</p>

<p>This instrument, though not capable of extreme accuracy,
might, by means of careful workmanship, and the addition of a
small telescope, be made sufficiently so for finding stars in the
day time; but such a one as that now described will answer
all the purposes of a learner, and enable very young people to
acquire a correct and extensive knowledge of the stars in a
very short time.</p>

<p>The surface of a cone has been adopted for the projection,
in preference to that of a globe or planisphere, having been
found, after repeated trials, the figure best suited to the nature
of the instrument.</p>

compiled with constant reference to Physiology, and elucidated
by twenty copper-plates</em>. By C. J. Carus, M.D.,
&#38;c. Translated from the German, by R. T. Gore, Member
of the Royal College of Surgeons in London. <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">I<span>F</span></span>
we except Sir Everard Home’s splendid work on comparative
anatomy, we have no original treatise on that subject
which deserves notice; and even Sir Everard’s lectures must
rather be considered as a series of essays on detached parts
of that branch of science, than as a regular and systematic
view of it. We have long been acquainted with the work of
Dr. Carus, and have always considered it as a laborious and
accurate epitome of the principal facts and authorities in
the study to which it relates. From the immense field of
inquiry which it embraces, it is necessarily complicated, and
<span class="xxpn" id="p378">[p378]</span>
in some places a little obscure, but it is entirely free from
those speculative and hypothetical wanderings which are too
characteristic of the German school of physiology; and
though it contains some systematic notions in which we cannot
acquiesce, and a few new words, not the most harmonious in
the world, it may very safely and properly be recommended
to the student as a text-book, and to the proficient as a work
of reference. The plates by which it is illustrated are upon
an economical scale, sometimes rather too small to be distinct,
but they are otherwise accurate and carefully drawn; and
we are aware that it is impossible to obviate these objections
without incurring such expense as would probably render
the work inaccessible to those readers for whom it is principally
compiled.</p>

<p>Mr. Gore has assiduously and faithfully executed the
difficult task of translation, and has added no inconsiderable
quantity of new and important matter in the form of notes,
rendering the English work more complete, and upon many
points much more satisfactory than the original.</p>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">T<span>HE</span></span>
population of London and its immediate environs may
be estimated at about two millions, and the annual consumption
of coals within the same district does not fall far
short of two millions of chaldrons, or seventy-two millions
of bushels. Of this prodigious quantity of inflammable
matter, a very considerable portion escapes combustion, and
lodges in the form of soot in our chimneys, or is vomited forth
to contaminate and cloud the atmosphere of the metropolis:
so great is this loss, that independent of the mere advantage
of getting rid of smoke, its prevention is an important economical
problem; and though the rage for smoke-burning
has passed over, we are quite certain that the subject still
deserves the most serious attention, being convinced that, of
the fuel consumed in the ordinary processes of warming our
houses and cooking food, at least one-third is uselessly
thrown away, and might be saved by a more economical
and scientific construction of common grates and fire-places.
All useful and well-conducted experiments, therefore, in
<span class="xxpn" id="p379">[p379]</span>
relation to these matters, deserve notice; and though much
of Mr. Bull’s essay is not applicable to our case, it contains
a variety of interesting facts and information: his experiments
appear to have been very carefully conducted, and should
be consulted by all those who are engaged in similar investigations.</p>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">P<span>ERFORMING</span></span>
with the blowpipe is something like playing
upon the fiddle—it looks mighty easy, but for its perfect
accomplishment requires a combination of skill and dexterity
which practice alone can confer. We are disposed, therefore,
to think lightly of those essays upon the subject which pretend
to instruct the beginner in the actual use of the instrument;
telling him how he is to puff out his cheeks, breathe
through his nose, make a valve of his tongue, and keep up a
<span class="xxpn" id="p381">[p381]</span>
perpetual stream through the nozzle of the tube; all which
is much easier described than done, and is entirely matter
of experimental acquisition, more easily attained without
than with the usual instructions. In the little work before
us, all these matters are passed over with fit brevity, and
the attention of the student is chiefly directed to the appearances
which different substances exhibit before the blowpipe,
and by which minerals may be distinguished and classed.
The history of these constitute the bulk of Mr. Griffin’s
duodecimo, being preceded only by a few remarks upon the
different kinds of blowpipe, respecting which we have merely
to observe that justice is not done to Mr. Newman, who
first suggested what is here called “Dr. Clarke’s blowpipe;”
indeed elsewhere the author seems a little angry with Mr.
Children for recommending Mr. Newman’s apparatus. We
observe, moreover, that no notice is taken of Mr. Newman’s
and several other papers on the blowpipe, which have appeared
in the old series of this Journal; nor of Dr. Clarke’s
original Essay, published in the second volume of that work,
from which, and sundry other symptoms, we conclude that
Mr. Griffin is a pupil of Dr. Thomas Thomson. Be this as
it may, we bear him no malice, and very conscientiously
recommend his book to the mineralogical student, as a
valuable and clear epitome of what relates to the behaviour
of substances before the blowpipe.</p>

an interloper among works on science; but it touches upon
many points of scientific inquiry, and upon botany especially,
and is compiled with so much evident labour and accuracy,
as to merit recommendation. The saints and festivals of

forth of the modest snowdrop, or the early bursting of the

glad to have their attention pleasingly directed to the successive

<h3><em class="italic">Conversations on the Animal Economy</em>.

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">W<span>E</span></span>
have more than once expressed our opinion on the subject
of conveying information to young people in the way
of “Conversations,” which in the present volumes are carried
on between Dr. A., Harriet, Sophia, and Charles; they
are at once instructive and amusing, and evidently the produce
of one possessed of much information upon the subjects
discussed, and, what is more to the point, of the art of
pleasantly and intelligibly conveying it.</p>

<p>The Conversations open with an account of the coverings
or integuments of animals; their arrangements by systematic
writers are then adverted to, and a short but useful description
is given of the varieties of mankind, as enumerated by
Blumenbach and illustrated by Camper. The bones and
muscles form the subjects of the fifth and sixth conversations;
they are concisely described, and with sufficient accuracy.
The brain and nervous system and the organs of sense are
next talked about. The doctrines of phrenology are fairly
explained; and in the conversations on smell and taste,
vision, hearing, and touch, the anatomy of the respective
organs, and their varieties in the different animal tribes are
treated of, the dulness of the details being relieved by physiological
illustrations. The remaining conversations are
occupied with an account of the principal functions of
animals, and of the several organs chiefly concerned in their
performance; the varieties of teeth and stomachs are here
treated of, and the structures of the heart and blood-vessels,
as concerned in circulation and respiration. The production
of heat by animal systems is then noticed; and the
twentieth and concluding conversation is employed in the
exposition of the general phenomena of growth and decay.
<span class="xxpn" id="p383">[p383]</span></p>

<p>We have thus briefly stated the contents of these volumes,
which are further illustrated by numerous woodcuts and
several plates; and are perfectly ready to commend the
performance as an extremely useful and proper book for
young persons, but <em class="italic">not</em>, in our opinion, of both sexes: we
should have been better pleased if Harriet and Sophy had
been replaced by William and Thomas; for we cannot
fancy the subjects here discussed as quite fit for young ladies.
Boys, on the contrary, ought to know much more of these
matters than they commonly do; and for conveying such
information in a pleasing and familiar, yet neither vulgar
nor superficial style, this compilation seems perfectly appropriate,
and will, we trust, find, as it ought, a numerous class
of readers.</p>

John Lindley, Esq., F.L.S., &#38;c. &#38;c. <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first">Upon his journey across the rocky mountains in April 1827,
in latitude 52° N., longitude 118° W., at an estimated elevation
of 12,000 feet above the level of the sea, the attention of Mr.
Douglas was attracted by a brilliant purple patch amidst the
surrounding snow. On approaching it, he was surprised to
find that the colour which had arrested his eye was caused
by the blossoms of a little plant, from which the superincumbent
snow had not yet melted away. The well-known Saxifraga
oppositifolia immediately occurred to his recollection, and he at
first imagined he had either discovered that species, or one
nearly allied to it; but upon a closer inspection, he perceived
that it was no Saxifraga, but a genus apparently new.
Specimens having been submitted to me for examination
since Mr. Douglas’s return, the following description has been
drawn
<span class="nowrap">up:—</span></p>

<p>The plant forms a thick tuft consisting of numerous perennial
branched stems, the lower of which are covered with the persistent
decayed leaves and fruit of previous summers. The <em class="italic">stems</em>
are round, bright purplish brown, covered with scattered, rigid,
branched, short hairs, and densely clothed with opposite spreading
leaves. The leaves are a dull glaucous green, semi-amplexicaul,
<span class="xxpn" id="p384">[p384]</span>
linear, obtuse, about five lines long and three-quarters of a
line broad, so closely covered with hairs like those of the
stem, that the whole epidermis is hidden. Their veins are
concealed by the hairs; but if the latter are removed, they
appear to consist of a thickened mid-rib, and a few nearly
simple spreading venæ primariæ. The <em class="italic">flowers</em> proceed from
the axillæ of the upper leaves, from three to six on each little
branch; at first they are sessile, but their foot-stalks subsequently
lengthen by degrees until the fruit is ripe, when they
are from three-quarters of an inch to one inch in length, and
covered with the same sort of hairs as the leaves and stem.
The <em class="italic">calyx</em> is hairy in like manner, obconical, angular, with
five equal erect narrowly triangular teeth, about the length of
the tube. The <em class="italic">corolla</em> is of a vivid purple colour, infundibuliform,
wholly destitute of pubescence; the <em class="italic">tube</em> is a little
ventricose and rather longer than the calyx, its whole length
being about three lines; the <em class="italic">limb</em> is spreading, five-parted
with cuneate, oblong, obtuse, segments; the orifice is guarded
by five transversely linear calli, placed under each sinus, and
corresponding to the same number of external depressions
of the neck of the tube. The <em class="italic">anthers</em> are linear oblong,
nearly sessile, opposite the segments of the corolla, and a little
enclosed within the tube. The <em class="italic">ovarium</em> is superior, of an
obovate figure, one-celled, with a central, free, fungilliform
placenta, the lower edge of which has five teeth corresponding
to an equal number of peltate ovula; the <em class="italic">style</em> is filiform, as
long as the tube of the corolla, and continuous with the
ovarium; <em class="italic">stigma</em>, a minute depressed cup. The <em class="italic">capsule</em> is
of a cartilaginous texture, surrounded by the persistent calyx;
one-celled, with five recurving valves; the <em class="italic">seeds</em> are two, peltate,
oblong, convex on the outside, concave in the inside, dark
brown, covered closely with minute dots or depressions; four
only having been found, their internal organization has not
been determined.</p>

<p>Hence it appears that, with the exception of the interior of
the seed, the whole structure of the plant is determinable:
it is also obvious that it is referable to Primulaceæ, of which it
possesses all the characters. In fact it is closely akin both to
Primula and Androsace. From both these genera, however,
<span class="xxpn" id="p385">[p385]</span>
its ovarium which exhibits the greatest instance of reduction
of ovula yet known in the order, and its dispermous capsule,
with oblong concave seeds, readily and essentially distinguish it.</p>

<p>I have, therefore, named it after its indefatigable discoverer,
whose active and successful researches in its native country,
richly entitle him to the distinction.</p>

Borealis seen in London on the Evening and Night of the 25th of
September, 1827; with Critical Remarks upon other Descriptions
of the same, and previous Appearances of the Meteor, both in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres</em>. By E. A. Kendall, Esq.,
F.S.A. <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">O<span>N</span></span>
the evening and right of the 25th of September last, the
horizon of the metropolis, toward the north, and toward the
north-west and the north-east, exhibited a remarkable display
of the meteor or phenomenon called, after the example of the
Italian philosopher Gassendi, Aurora Borealis.</p>

<p>The weather, for many days preceding, had been mild,
with alternate sunshine, clouds, and showers. The wind had
been generally in the west and south-west quarters; though
on the 18th and 19th it was in the north-west, and on the
20th in the north-east. The barometer, at three o’clock in
the afternoon, had stood at from <span class="nowrap">30° 40′</span>
to <span class="nowrap">30° 20′,</span> to which
latter height it had descended on the 20th; and, from that
day to the 25th, it had remained, at <span class="nowrap">29° 90′</span>
and <span class="nowrap">29° 75′.</span> The
thermometer, at the same hour, between the 14th and the
20th, had ranged between <span class="nowrap">65° 6′</span>
and <span class="nowrap">59° 2′;</span> and it stood, on
the 25th, at <span class="nowrap">59° 6′,</span>
with the wind in the south-west. The
sky, toward the zenith, on the evening of that day, was
<span class="xxpn" id="p386">[p386]</span>
partially clear, and partially covered with shifting clouds. On
the north, and on the west and east of north, heavy and
stationary clouds blackened the whole horizon, to an elevation
of more than five degrees; and the southern hemisphere was
dark with dark clouds from the horizon to the zenith.</p>

<hr class="hr12pct" />

<p>I. By some, the Aurora was seen from the time when the
sun was set; but the first appearance in the heavens, which
attracted the attention of the present writer, whose situation at
the moment shut out from him the horizon upon all sides but
the west, was that of a certain breadth of red or copper-coloured
light, or of light of a colour nearly resembling that reflected
by an ordinary conflagration of buildings, pointing upward
from the west. The colour, indeed, was dissimilar from that
which is usual upon the occurrence of a fire on a cloudy
night; yet, in the absence of any other immediate explanation,
he should not have hesitated so to understand it, except
for the figure within which it was circumscribed, and which,
instead of being diffusive, and less and less conspicuous toward
its extremities, or rounded in its outline, like masses of ruddy
smoke, had the peculiarities of an equal breadth, rectilinear
sides, a square top, and sharp outlines. Its height was continually
increasing; but not even that phenomenon, nor even
the curve to the eastward, across the heavens, and which it
presently began to add to its figure, were appearances absolutely
to dissipate the illusion of the existence of a fire; and
it was scarcely, therefore, till this breadth of colour, throwing
itself entirely over the heavens, and descending, at its projected
extremity, toward the east, formed an arch, of which,
perhaps, the elevation was seventy degrees, (which was
not the work of many minutes, the motion, at the same
time, being visible, but of moderate rapidity,) that its real
character of a natural phenomenon distinctly impressed itself
upon the mind of the present writer, its observer. While
this, however, was proceeding, the road which he was pursuing
had brought him more into view of the north-western
and northern horizon; and, then, the light in the north, and to
the west of north, which, from behind the clouds that lined
the horizon, seemed like the light of a rising moon, or of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p387">[p387]</span>
breaking day, together with the vertical projection of rays of
light, beneath and above the arch, removed every doubt as to
the cause of the appearance, by demonstrating its connexion
with an Aurora Borealis.</p>

<p>It was now about a quarter past eleven o’clock. The sky,
beneath the lower or inner edge of the arch, was clear and
star-light, and, through the contrast created by the ruddy
colour placed against it, appeared of a lively blue. The upper
edge of the arch, in the meantime, was relieved only by the
dark gray of the clouds, which, with more or less continuity,
overhung the upper part of the heavens. But these latter
were now dispersing; the cloudless zenith, which presently
afterwards disclosed itself, was now progressively and swiftly
preparing; and, as the clouds moved and fled, the outlines
of the arch lost their sharpness, the colour changed, from
that of fire or of copper, to something more or less of purple
or of the rose; it spread itself in the vapour, and with the
vapour vanished.</p>

<hr class="hr12pct" />

<p><span class="allcaps">II</span>. But this was only the curtain of the stage, behind the
folds of which the true scene had its existence. This latter,
still concealed, to a certain and uniform height, by a parapet,
as it were, of dark and unbroken clouds, consisted, first, in
the ground of white light, already described as resembling that
of a sky in the midst of which clouds shut out the disk of the
moon, or rather that in which the rising sun is just about to
appear; and, secondly, in a range of columns, or fountains, or
jets of light, more coloured than the ground, which, rising from
behind the ridge or parapet of clouds, and from and in the
midst of the white light, formed, together, not the figure which
would have been produced by their uniform convergence
toward the zenith, but one which bore some resemblance to
that assumed by the sticks of a fan, or still more to the appearance
of stalks in a flower-basket, or in a sheaf of corn. For,
in this manner, the column, which, in general terms, may be
called the central one, and which arose in the due north, was
vertical, and therefore projected toward the zenith; while those
which extended from it upon either side, that is, toward the
west or toward the east, gradually inclined more and more
<span class="xxpn" id="p388">[p388]</span>
toward the horizon on their respective sides; and, as to the
outer columns on the east, inclined, not in rectilinear figures,
but in curves more or less decided. In these columns or
coruscations several particulars were to be remarked.</p>

<p>1. That, within the space of from one hour to two, the
whole group appeared to traverse the horizon together, from
the west of north to the east of north, as if upon one movable
base, or as if the source of their appearance became gradually
exhausted to the west of north, and grew gradually into activity
upon the east of north; alternatives of explanation, however,
which might materially affect the theory of their production.
During the whole change, in the meantime, the
north preserved its splendour, appearing uniformly as the
focus of the fire, or as the pivot of the machine, or as the well
from which all else was supplied. The change consisted in the
appearance of columns, of more or less magnitude, strength,
and brightness, more or less advanced from the north toward
the west, or from the north toward the east; but the north,
during all this variation, suffered no other change than this,
that whereas, in the beginning of the evening, the greater
portion of columns rose to its west, while, in the latter
part of the night, the greater portion arose to its east. But,
besides this general configuration, and this united motion of
the meteor, there was to be observed, in the several columns
themselves, both the variations of colour which distinguished
one from another, and the irregular and independent movement
of each, always in the direction of its length or altitude,
and situate in the interior, as it were, of its body; and also
that peculiarity of form which distinguishes these coruscations
from all other luminous appearances.</p>

<p>2. The colours of the columns, in that part of their height
which is nearest their base, and where, as a ground, they had
only the white light of the horizon, by which, and by their
motion, and it should, perhaps, be added, their vividness,
they were distinguished, is a point upon which the writer
speaks with some hesitation, and with respect to the more
close observation of which he could like to enjoy a second
opportunity of beholding the phenomenon. The variety and
richness, and sometimes the terrible grandeur, of the colours
<span class="xxpn" id="p389">[p389]</span>
exhibited in the Aurora Borealis, is the constant theme of
spectators and naturalists; and, upon the late occasion, an
observer, apparently of more regularly scientific habits of pursuit
than himself<a id="fnanchor_120_84" href="#fn_120_84" class="fnanchor">120</a>, has particularly insisted upon a column, of
a violet colour, rising west of north, and the place of which he
thinks corresponding with that of the <em class="italic">magnetic pole</em>; a coincidence
from which, as it may seem, he would believe a confirmation
of the <em class="italic">magnetic theory</em> of the production of the Aurora
to be obtained. In setting down the present description, the
writer tasks himself to the most faithful description of what
he actually saw, and suppression of all desire to support or
condemn a theory, of which his mind is capable; and by those
rules, therefore, the whole statement will be guided. His description
already differs from that of some of his fellow-witnesses,
as will be expressly considered below; but he confesses
that while, in point of persuasion, he much inclines
to the idea, that all the light displayed by the Aurora is in
itself white, and only tinctured to the eye of the spectator by
the atmospherical medium through which it is seen; and
while, with respect to all those deeper colours, whether crimson
or purple, or blood-colour, which appal the superstitious,
and are described by the picturesque narrator as exhibiting
the terrible in matters of vision, he judges it supposable that the
whole machinery consists in the same interposition of vapour,
near the horizon, which so often gives to the sun and moon
themselves the appearance of being coloured like blood:
while, therefore, he still adheres to his opinion, that the
colours ascribed to the Aurora are wholly extrinsic; and, to
borrow the words of a scientific writer, “dependent upon the
medium through which they are seen;” he is obliged to
acknowledge, that it did appear to him, that the several columns,
in truth, were yet variously coloured, of pale, but bright
and pleasing colours, from a pale yellow to a pale pink and a
pale violet, and this in the direction of their height or length,—a
phenomenon which wholly excludes, as to those columns
and their colours, the influence of an interposing medium, the
effect of which would be perceived horizontally, and across the
whole range of columns, or part of the range, and not
<span class="xxpn" id="p390">[p390]</span>
vertically nor obliquely, according to the direction of each column,
and within the limits of its sides. He confesses, also, that he
did take notice of the pale, but bright violet-coloured column,
distinguished also by its breadth and height, and situated to
the west of north; but which column, he is surely right in
adding, ultimately moved, with those next to it, toward the
north. He distinctly and pointedly observed, at the same
time, that the columns which stood due north were always
white, and that the colours of the other columns appeared to
strengthen in proportion as they were distant from the due
north, either west or east; and he came to a fixed conclusion,
while the phenomenon was under his eye, that, to his judgment
at least, the strength of the fire, so to say, was in that
point of the horizon which lay due north; and that there was
a diminished brightness, with a proportionable increase of
colour, to the right and left.</p>

<p>3. As to the separate movements of the columns, these, in
the first place, were quick, and forced upon the eye, while the
movement which gradually deployed or advanced the right
wing of the celestial arm, and gradually contracted or withdrew
the left, was slow, and perceived only by its results; and,
in the second place, while these latter were parallel to the
horizon, the former were either vertical, or in the oblique or
curved direction of the bodies of the columns. But this
motion consisted either in vibration, or in irregular but alternate
projections and contractions; and the motion of each
column, as has been said, was independent on that of others.
Rarely, two adjoining columns were in motion at the same
time. Almost always the moving column or columns were
seen to start from the midst of others, which, for the time,
were quiescent, but which had had their turn before, and
would presently have it again. What eminently struck the
writer, however, was the internal motion of that to which he
cannot allow himself to give another name than that of the apparent
luminous material of the columns. It seemed to him as
if the volume of each column or coruscation was itself composed
of parallel lines of luminous matter, arranged in the
direction of the column, and every one of which was separately
the subject of movements similar to those of the entire
<span class="xxpn" id="p391">[p391]</span>
column, or entire bundle of lines; or as if the whole column
were like the stalk of a plant, and filled with upright and
luminous fibres, or like a skein of thread, drawn vertically or
obliquely, and of which each particular thread should have
particular motion in the direction of the whole; or (what
he thought the comparison which proclaimed the very nature
of the material of the columns) like fountains, or jets of water
in the sun, in which every particular particle should be
moving in the general direction of the jet, and yet each moving
and shining for itself.</p>

<p>4. And this apparent nature of the substance of the columns
or coruscations allies itself to what finally regards them;
namely, their form. In this description, they have hitherto
been spoken of by the name of columns or pillars; and the
similitude, which that name suggests, is justified by the general
figure of all the lower parts of their bodies, which, unlike the
figure of rays of light on the one hand, and unlike that of
flames of fire on the other, is a tall or lengthened object, of small
comparative diameter or breadth, and of which the sides consist
in right and nearly parallel lines. But, by the English,
these columns, pillars, or coruscations, were anciently called
so many <em class="italic">burning spears</em>; and they have also received the
names of <em class="italic">streamers</em> and <em class="italic">pencills</em><a id="fnanchor_121_85" href="#fn_121_85" class="fnanchor">121</a>, which two latter, in the
history of appurtenants of war, signify long and narrow,
and pointed banners or flags. Their similitude to flags is excusably
fancied from their quick, capricious, and irregular
motions, but their likening to “spears,” is that which may
claim to be thought the most felicitous, as to the true conception
of their form, as it is also that, the idea of which contributes
to render the phenomenon the most fearful in the
<span class="xxpn" id="p392">[p392]</span>
survey of ignorance and superstition. But the
<span class="smmaj">SPEAR-SHAPE</span>
is descriptive, because the coruscations, unlike rays of light,
and unlike flames of fire, have neither the obtuse figure of
a pyramid, nor the acute one of an obelisk, upright or reversed;
but, after rising, through almost their whole height or
length, of an equal or nearly equal diameter, terminate in a
point which is formed, not of right lines, like the point of a
dagger, but of curved lines, so as to form the rounded point
of a spear, or that figure which is so familiar to botanists,
as spoken of “spear-shaped” leaves. A ray of light, in
whatever direction it is thrown, broadens, with right-lined
sides, from the first point of its departure, to the furthest
stretch of its projection; a flame of fire points uniformly
upward, with the same regularity of form, excepting only as
it is liable to undulation from the motion of the atmosphere;
but, the columns, spears, streamers, or coruscations of the
Aurora Borealis, have no form but that under review.</p>

<p>5. About half-past eleven o’clock, or nearer to twelve,
several powerful columns shot toward the zenith; while, to
the east of north, others were at once curved in their form,
and projected in an angle of about thirty degrees with the
horizon. But while, upon the west of north, the sky, above
the ridge of clouds, was entirely clear, so that, there, the
columns played upon a ground which formed a slight contrast
with themselves, here, the clouds were still heavy, and
the columns behind them appeared, in consequence, of a fiery
red, deepening as they approached the outer edge of the whole
display, at which was the sharpest outline, contrasted in the
distinctest manner with the dark sky. The light upon that
side called to the mind of the writer the “dunnest smoke of
hell,” of Macbeth; while, as to its outer line, as seen from the
east end of Pall-mall, the sides of the stone spire of St. Martin’s
church, which rose to the eastward of it in the sky, were
not more sharply defined; the dark intervening sky affording
relief to both, though not equally so, upon account of the
superior brightness of even the obscured columns. But, in
taking leave of this columnar, or spear-like, and main part of
the Aurora, it may be permitted to add, that, in those tapering
forms, together with their motions, (though the comparison
<span class="xxpn" id="p393">[p393]</span>
may still be sufficiently remote and fanciful,) it was easy to
discern the origin of their having been resembled to weapons
of war; that is, to the spears of an army, raised, lowered, laid
at angles, and gleaming, glittering, crossing, and clashing in
battle. And equally, too, from their quick, varied, and separate,
and, as it were, whimsical motions, might they reasonably
receive, in their milder displays, and in moments of more
peaceful and cheerful association, the very different name of
<em class="italic">merry dancers</em>!</p>

<hr class="hr12pct" />

<p><span class="allcaps">III</span>. Though, as will presently be found, it is the ruling
idea of the present writer, that the Aurora Borealis is a single
object, its appearance, when unmodified by the accompaniments
of clouds or fogs, being merely that of its own coruscations,
playing in the free expanse, yet for the purposes of
analytical description and contemplation, it is here thought
convenient to divide it into the three parts in which, through
the temporary and accidental intervention of the coloured arch
before-mentioned, it appeared in the night now in recollection.
These three supposititious parts, then, may be understood as
follows: first, the arch, belt, or band which was temporarily
thrown across the heavens; second, the main body of the
coruscations below the arch; and third, the coruscations above
it, and in or near the zenith. It is of these only that it remains
to speak.</p>

<p>It was not till about midnight that the zenith itself (which,
however, formed the southern boundary to this part of the display)
became the scene of a class of appearances, differing,
indeed, essentially, in their forms, from those in the horizon,
but closely connected, as it may be believed, with all the materials,
and all the movements, of these latter. The zenith, at
that hour, was cloudless, and resplendent with stars, and
the air was freshened by a gentle breeze from the south.
Between the earth and the stars above, there was no apparent
intervening vapour, and nothing, therefore, save that atmospherical
fluid which eludes the sight. But, through that
medium, if such only it was, coruscations were now continually
shooting, of which the appearance was, that it overspread
this portion of the vault of heaven with an ever-shaken
<span class="xxpn" id="p394">[p394]</span>
sheet of thin, gauzy, white, or yellowish-white, and nebulous,
or cloudy matter. To the writer, this superior portion of the
Aurora, though not the most lustrous, and, therefore, not the
most striking of the whole, was yet by no means the least
interesting and inviting to attention; for, here, as its appeared
to him, the <em class="italic">material</em> and the manner of operation of the
meteor were brought nearer to the eye, and exhibited with such
a back-ground (the starry heavens) as gave a transparent view
of the same matter as that, which, (as he thought,) seen vertically,
and in the horizon, appeared comparatively, at least,
opaque. The transparent medium, however, above, through
which, even when shook or vibrating, and even when whitened
with light, the stars were always seen in more or less brightness,
was now in continual motion; or, meteoric light or matter
was continually, though irregularly, and as it were, playfully
shot through it. The illuminated substance (whether the
atmospherical fluid, reflecting the light of the meteor, or the
luminous body of the meteor itself, but probably the latter)
was incessantly discovering itself in different places; now here,
now there, now bright, now dim; but far less in a manner, or
with an appearance, such to be compared with lightning, than with
such as resembled the changes of ripple upon the bosom of a
wide-spread water, when a variable breeze blows over it; first
in one part, and then in another; and now in one direction,
and the next moment in a second. Or, the canopy of heaven,
at this time, might be said to be composed of a lace or gauze
bearing a figured pattern, of which the fluttering motion
continually changed the places, or hid or re-displayed the
figures represented; or the picture, perhaps, will be more
easily imagined, if conveyed in the very appropriate language
of an older hand, which, referring to the appearances displayed
in the zenith, remarks, “They break out in places
where none were seen before, skimming briskly along the
heavens; are suddenly extinguished, and leave behind a uniform
dusky track. This, again, is brilliantly illuminated in
the same manner, and as suddenly left a dull blank.” It
should be understood, however, that, at least as seen by the
present writer, in this mixture of white and blue, the blue
was always the preponderating colour; or, in other words,
<span class="xxpn" id="p395">[p395]</span>
that, the field of the unoccupied zenith always bore a large
proportion to the space or spaces covered, however momentarily,
with light, or with the luminous substance. For the
rest, the particular mentioned in the passage which has now
been quoted, namely, that of the residue of a dusky track,
after the departure of the white light, did not, if it was
there, attract the attention of the present writer, upon the late
occasion; but he certainly, in many instances, remarked the
return of the light to the places in which it had been visible
before; and this feature, either with or without that of the
continuance of a dusky track, is possibly capable of adding
some support to the general opinion which he conceived at the
moment, which all subsequent information has still allowed
him to retain, and of which he proposes to make further use;
namely, that the appearances in the zenith are only extended
exhibitions of the luminous phenomena in the horizon,
or their southern extremities, or the tops of columns projected
from the northward. He thought that, in the zenith,
he saw the same material, parcelled out, attenuated or diluted,
spread thin, and, as it were, shown with greater transparency,
with that which, in thicker volume, with more accumulated
strength, intenser light, with more solid body, and withal
behind a denser mass of atmospherical vapour, arose, and
glowed, and sometimes gloomed, in the horizon. But, be this
as it may, it is, perhaps, this upper part of the exhibition, in
which the lights or streamers seem to interweave, or cross and
recross each other, to dance in and out of the area, and to
indulge in motions still more capricious or anomalous than
is probably the real fact; it is, perhaps, this upper part which
has alternated, as before recalled to view, the names and similitudes
of spears, gleaming, glittering, interposing and clashing
as in battle, and of <em class="italic">merry dancers</em>, the latter the gayer comparison
of the dancing north.</p>

<p><span class="allcaps">IV</span>. The Aurora continued to fix the attention of the writer
till between twelve and one o’clock of the morning of the
26th; and he presumes that it continued visible till the superior
light of the rising day eclipsed its glory. The 26th was
warm, but oppressed with fog, through which the sun broke
<span class="xxpn" id="p396">[p396]</span>
only at intervals; and, between four and five o’clock in the
evening, a small but steady rain commenced, and continued, or
rather increased in heaviness, till after midnight. Between
eleven and twelve, while it still rained, the writer, on looking
at the sky, which was covered with a uniform mass of clouds,
the writer observed, from point to point, over the northern and
southern hemispheres, a glow of ruddy light, which he suspected,
and still suspects, to have been produced by the light
of the continued Aurora, reflected by the vapour. He took the
opinion of a fellow-traveller, which coincided with his own;
but it has not come to his knowledge that any individual, himself
and his companion excepted, has formed a similar conjecture—nor,
indeed, is it impossible that it was no more than the
light of the hidden moon. The night of the 27th was star-light,
though with fog near the surface; and there was then no
appearance of an Aurora. The night of the 28th was remarkably
clear, and there was still no return of the Aurora. The
morning of the 29th was warm, with continued and heavy
rain; but, after this, there succeeded a week or more of
clear and dry weather; and these united particulars close
the history of the phenomenon, as far as belong to the personal
observation of the writer. The direction of the winds,
and the state of the barometer and thermometer, were of
the same general description, during many days subsequent
to the appearance of the Aurora on the 25th, as that which
had belonged to them from the 20th, and almost for many
days before, and of which the particulars have been stated
above; and these remarks may merit record, as connected
with the question of the ordinary duration of the Aurora,
and of the weather by which it may be thought produced,
or which it may be thought to bring. In many instances,
it has been observed, even in its splendour, and even in
southern latitudes, for several nights in succession; and an influence
upon the weather has likewise been expected from its
appearance. Upon this occasion, there was no remarkable
change in the latter till the night of the fourteenth day after
the Aurora (October 10th), when there occurred a violent gale
of wind from the south-west, accompanied with loud thunder,
and the most vivid lightning; subsequently to which, as usual,
<span class="xxpn" id="p397">[p397]</span>
the air, for a few days, was felt to be cooler than before.
It has been said, that a gale of wind, from the south-west, is
always to be looked for within twenty-four hours after the
Aurora.</p>

<hr class="hr12pct" />

<p>V. The astronomical writer, already more than once mentioned,
speaking of the Aurora of the 25th of September, describes
it as “that mysterious phenomenon;” and Mr. Adams,
the meteorological correspondent of the publication referred to,
records it as, “perhaps, as conspicuous as any that has ever
been seen in England<a id="fnanchor_122_86" href="#fn_122_86" class="fnanchor">122</a>;” so that, assuming these impressions
in both instances to be well founded, neither the present state
of science upon the one hand, nor the specimen of the phenomenon
upon the other, are such as to discourage either of
the objects of the remainder of these pages; namely, the one to
contribute, as fully as possible, to the completion of a faithful
account of the Aurora, as seen in London upon the late
occasion, by uniting, and by analysing the descriptions that
have caught already the eye of the writer; and the other, to
correct, and to enlarge if it should be practicable, the natural
history of this description of meteor, by the comparison of
what has hitherto been usually written upon the subject, either
descriptively or philosophically, as well with the results of
the late actual observations, as with the several facts or
opinions more anciently registered. According to some, the
interval which had elapsed, since an equal or a superior display
of this phenomenon was witnessed in London, is twenty-four
years, and, according to others, thirty-six; nor is the scanty list
of examples scientifically recorded, at all inconsistent, from the
wide separation, as well as irregularity of its dates, with such a
view of the infrequency and uncertainty of any considerable
appearance in other southern latitudes. The opportunity,
therefore, now offered, ought not, perhaps, to be neglected; and
the writer is not wholly without the prospect, that, upon a re-examination,
both of opinions and facts, some safe and inevitable
conclusions may be elicited, both as to the history and
the theory of the meteor, hitherto, the one hastily received,
<span class="xxpn" id="p398">[p398]</span>
and the other negligently overlooked, or unwarrantably contradicted.
The paragraphs, then, which immediately follow, will
connect and review the accounts of the writer’s fellow-observer
of the 25th of September; while those which succeed will be
devoted to a brief enumeration of statements already recorded
in books; though, to a certain extent, both these paths will
involve us in mixed investigations, historical and theoretical.</p>

<p>1. “It first appeared,” says Mr. Adams, who dates from
Edmonton, in Middlesex, “about eight o’clock in the evening,
as a strong white light, much resembling the approach of sunrise;
and so continued till a short time after eleven, when a
considerable number of dark clouds collected toward the north
and north-west, and several streaks of a pale white light were
seen proceeding from the clouds, and reaching nearly to the
zenith. But the most remarkable part of the phenomenon was
exhibited in a N.N.E. direction, where, at about 30° above
the horizon, was a small dense cloud, above which was a
broad streak curved, and about 10° in length, varying in colour
from a deep copper hue to a red.” “From this,” continues
Mr. Adams, “the coruscations were incessant, and remarkably
bright, darting frequently to the zenith, where they were
frequently crossed by others equally bright and numerous,
proceeding from the west toward the east.”</p>

<p>2. The astronomical writer, who dates from Deptford, describes
the phenomenon as commencing at a quarter past eight
o’clock, and travelling, from west and north-west, to north-east;
and the streaks, or streamers, or, as he denominates
them, the flashes, “converging to the zenith,” and “coruscating
with great velocity.” He also particularises the peculiar appearance
of “a streak or column of a phosphorescent violet
tinge;” and adds, “The <em class="italic">two</em> red beams of light, seen in the
<em class="italic">easterly</em> and <em class="italic">westerly</em> direction [directions], were diametrically
opposite to each other, and ninety degrees distant from the
violet light (by far the most luminous, though comparatively
quiescent) which was to the west of north, <em class="italic">and therefore could
not be far from the magnetic meridian</em>, which would be crossed at
right angles by a line joining the places of the red beams. The
southern edges of these were accurately defined, not blending
with the adjacent azure, but most distinct from it, and
<span class="xxpn" id="p399">[p399]</span>
perpendicular to the horizon.” Finally, this gentleman speaks of
the general luminous aspect, as “much resembling the tail of a
comet,” and says, that Ursa Major, and other stars, were visible
through its medium; that three meteoric stars also appeared,
during the phenomenon, in the east and north-east; and that
the entire horizon was obscured by dark, heavy clouds, from
three to five degrees in height<a id="fnanchor_123_87" href="#fn_123_87" class="fnanchor">123</a>.</p>

<p>3. Besides these observers, two or three others, if not
many more, less scientific, perhaps, but yet entitled to attention,
have communicated to different newspapers their accounts
of the same phenomena. “The metropolis,” says one of these,
“was surprised on Tuesday night by a brilliant display of
Northern Lights, which but very seldom stray so far south.
The last which we beheld in London were in the autumn of
1804, about the end of September, or beginning of October;
and the fancied prodigy filled all the superstitious heads, at
the time, with fearful prognostics, and loosened the tongues of
a hundred prophets. The spectacle, then, was truly magnificent.
On Tuesday night (the 25th) the northern parts of the
heavens displayed, about eleven o’clock, so ruddy a blaze, as to
appear like the reflection of a mighty conflagration. An hour
later, the red hue was gone; but the whole horizon, from the
north to the east, was lined with <em class="italic">a thin cloud</em>, from which the
rays of light rolled, or sudden rays flashed up, and as suddenly
vanished, to appear in a different part.” “At about half past
eleven o’clock,” says a second, “my attention was attracted to a
singular appearance of light and streakiness in the sky. I observed
it for nearly two hours. The sky, to the north, was
obscured, for about fifteen degrees above the horizon, by a
<em class="italic">dense</em> stratum of black clouds; from the upper edge of this, the
light became first apparent, extending from nearly north-east to
north-west, exceeding considerably in power that arising from
the moon just previous to its rising. From this broad stratum
of pale yellowish light shot beautiful <em class="italic">pencils</em>, of a luminous, hazy
appearance, up to the very zenith, changing momentarily in
length and intensity. During this period, the wind blew gently
from the south; and I frequently observed, that when it freshened
<span class="xxpn" id="p400">[p400]</span>
a little, the Aurora Borealis became more brilliant in its
appearance, sending beautiful coruscations of light, in rapid
succession, towards the zenith, and frequently passing that
point ten or fifteen degrees to the southward. I have been
assured, by those who are well acquainted with this beautiful
phenomenon, that they have not seen any appearance of it
equal in brilliancy and beauty to this, for upwards of six and
thirty years.” “Last night,” says a third, “we were favoured
with that interesting phenomenon, the Aurora Borealis, or
Northern Twilight, which so often amuses and cheers our
neighbours in the north, but seldom, I believe, is seen in our
latitude. It was without those varied colours,” adds this
writer, “which cause it to be a grand spectacle in those regions.”
“Not far from the horizon,” he adds, “in the northern
hemisphere, were transparent bodies of light, <em class="italic">eclipsing</em> the brightness
of the stars, which, however, were perceptible through it.
From hence, beams of light, varying in degrees of brightness
and breadth, shot up towards the zenith; here streamers of
light flew from the east to the west, and from west to east.
The southern hemisphere was cloudless, the stars shining with
brilliancy. By the light of this phenomenon, I could discern
the time of night, which was between eleven and twelve, as well
as other objects, as they appear on a moon-light night, when
the moon is obscured by clouds.” “The sky in the north,” we
are told by the fourth, “appeared as if a light shone from behind
some dark masses of clouds. As I approached Hampstead,
the silvery light was gradually tinged with rosy spiral
streams, like those which sometimes precede the rising and
follow the setting sun. These spiral red streaks did not appear
to move quickly; but they were subsequently followed by the
<em class="italic">merry dancers</em>, which fully maintained the character bestowed
upon them by our northern neighbours. After passing through
Hampstead, I crossed the heath, and came down what is called
North-end Hill, to Golder’s Green, Hendon. When you arrive
at the foot of the hill, you enter upon the open part of Golder’s
Green, where you have a clear and unobstructed view of the
sky from west to north. I never shall forget the grandeur of the
scene which awaited me there. A continuous border of dark
cloud skirted the horizon completely from west to north, whilst
<span class="xxpn" id="p401">[p401]</span>
from behind it, incessantly and rapidly shot up the most beautiful
coruscations of white light, which, being relieved by the
dark border, added double brilliancy to the ever-shifting scene.”</p>

<hr class="hr12pct" />

<p><span class="allcaps">VI</span>. But, after transcribing these respective accounts, it
may be permitted, for the purpose of uniting them with that
submitted in the preceding pages, to remark,</p>

<p>1. That the account by Mr, Adams, of the appearance
worn by the Aurora at an early hour in the evening, is, no
doubt, entirely correct; and that it is easy to understand,
from this description of that early appearance, why little observation
was attracted to the phenomenon till about eleven
o’clock at night, the time assigned, as well in this, as in all
the other accounts, for the commencement of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>2. That the “streaks of a pale white light,” which Mr.
Adams describes as proceeding, a short time after eleven,
“<em class="italic">from</em> the clouds,” must be understood, as stated by the writer
last quoted, as proceeding “<em class="italic">from behind</em> the clouds;” that,
when the astronomical writer at Deptford speaks of Ursa
Major and other stars being seen through the Aurora, it must
be recollected, that, perhaps, this remark should apply to the
medium of the thin and shifting lights in or near the zenith; and,</p>

<p>3. That it is with respect to the “broad streak, curved,” of
Mr. Adams; the “<em class="italic">two</em> red beams of light,” of the astronomical
observer at Deptford; and the “arch” of the present description,
that the principal, if not only discordance obtains. Neither
of the other three writers appears to have seen any thing,
whether of one “broad streak, curved,” and “varying in colour
from a deep copper hue to a red,” or of “<em class="italic">two</em> red beams,” as
spoken by the writer at Deptford; while, in each of the three
accounts in which that part of the phenomenon is actually
referred to, the descriptions are materially
<span class="nowrap">dissimilar:—</span></p>

<p>1. The writer at Edmonton mentions only a single streak,
while the writer at Deptford speaks of <em class="italic">two</em>.</p>

<p>2. The writer at Edmonton describes his single streak as
curved, while the writer at Deptford says nothing of curvature;
and, in describing the position of the beams as “perpendicular
to the horizon,” may seem to leave no curvature to be
understood.
<span class="xxpn" id="p402">[p402]</span></p>

<p>3. The writer at Edmonton seems to lift his “broad curved
streak” much above the horizon; for he first places a small
dense cloud 30° above the horizon, and, then, his broad streak
above the cloud; thus describing a curve of which the situation
was near the zenith, while the writer at Deptford is describing
“two red beams,” standing perpendicularly to the horizon.</p>

<p>4. The writer at Edmonton places his “broad streak, curved,”
“in a N.N.E. direction;” while the writer at Deptford records
“two red beams of light, seen in the easterly and westerly
direction.” Lastly,</p>

<p>5. The writer at Edmonton seems to make coruscations,
“incessant and remarkably bright,” dart from his “broad
streak, curved;” while the writer at Deptford seems only
anxious to place his “two red beams,” as perpendicular pillars,
standing on either side of the <em class="italic">magnetic meridian</em>.</p>

<hr class="hr12pct" />

<p><span class="allcaps">VII</span>. And, from the whole of this, from the total silence of
four accounts, and from the extreme discordance of the other
three, the present writer presumes to draw the following inferences,
including that of the accuracy of his own original
statement:</p>

<p>1. That the two perpendicular red beams of light, of the
writer at Deptford, should be joined with broad curved streaks
of a deep copper, or red hue, of the writer at Edmonton, to
complete the <em class="italic">arch</em> which has been spoken of in the foregoing
pages.</p>

<p>2. That this <em class="italic">arch</em>, or curved streak, with its feet east and
west, sent forth no coruscations itself; but that the coruscations
rose beneath it, and passed above it.</p>

<p>3. That it was described upon the clouds only; was no part
of the Aurora; and, from its connexion with the clouds only,
had an evanescence which, on the one hand, was the cause
of the various descriptions, and, on the other, of no descriptions
at all. The present writer observed this part of the
phenomenon from its beginning to its ending. He saw it rise
in the west, extend itself from the north, and descend in the east;
and he thinks it reasonable to ascribe the variations concerning
it, in the coincident narratives, to the different points of time
to which alone they really refer. The writers at Edmonton
<span class="xxpn" id="p403">[p403]</span>
and Deptford seem to have had their attention fixed upon
it at different epochs of its progress; and all the four other
writers, who have been cited, seem to speak of a time subsequent
to its disappearance. The present writer does not
recollect the small cloud below it, spoken of by Mr. Adams;
but he well remembers the clouds above it, and along and
near the northern edge of which it seems to be formed. He
does not recollect seeing its definite <em class="italic">southern</em> outline contrasted
with the azure sky; but he well remembers seeing that outline
contrasted with the dark clouds above it, or to its southward;
and also the contrast of its definite, <em class="italic">northern</em> outline, as contrasted
with the azure sky beneath.</p>

<hr class="hr12pct" />

<p><span class="allcaps">VIII</span>. It is necessary to take notice, also, of what is said
above, by the astronomical observer at Deptford, as to the
“flashes converging to the zenith,” and, further, of the omission,
both by this writer and by Mr. Adams, to speak of the
curved beam, streamer, or coruscation, to the east of north,
as described above. The whole veracity of the foregoing
description depends upon the denial of a uniform convergence
of the streamers, pillars, columns, or coruscations
toward the zenith; nor was it, in all probability, the intention
of the writer at Deptford, to assert any such convergence,
but only to speak of those coruscations, or shifting lights,
in the zenith, which are described by Mr. Adams as crossing
each other from east to west. It is remarkable, at the
same time, that neither the one nor the other of these writers
have mentioned that direct reverse of convergence which marked
the general figure and arrangement of the streamers or columns
of the Aurora, and which was so opposite to what would have
been given to it by the phenomenon of convergence. Indeed,
the violent curve of the extreme column to the N. E.
or N. N. E., shrouded, too, as that column was with a body of
dense vapour through which its light appeared of a deep and
dull red colour, might make the description of this itself answer
to the “broad streak, curved,” of Mr. Adams, if we were not
certain, from other particulars mentioned, that Mr. Adams
really refers to the curve which formed part of the <em class="italic">arch</em>. For
the rest, no mention of the real directions of the several columns
having been made by any observer of the Aurora of the 25th
<span class="xxpn" id="p404">[p404]</span>
of September but himself, and especially none of the outward
curve of the easternmost column, it is satisfactory to the
writer to have found an account of an appearance similar to
this last, in an Aurora of which he will presently have occasion
to speak.</p>

<hr class="hr12pct" />

<p><span class="allcaps">IX</span>. Finally, there is an observation to be made upon that
part of the description, by the second correspondent of the
newspapers, where it is said, that during the appearance of the
coruscations in the zenith, “the wind blew gently from the
south,” and the spectator “frequently observed, that when it
freshened a little, the Aurora Borealis became more brilliant in
its appearance;” to which it may also seem the writer’s intention
to add,—“sending beautiful coruscations of light, in rapid succession
toward the zenith, and frequently passing that point,
ten or fifteen degrees to the southward.” Now the reality of
any dependence of the light and motion of the Aurora upon
the freshening of the breeze, would seem too strongly to affect
the question of the nature and action of the <em class="italic">auroral matter</em>,
to be admitted without cautious examination. In truth, what
was it that constituted the luminous matter which we saw in
the zenith? The stars were visible through it. But for luminous
appearances that flew or skimmed along the heavens, we should
have said, that the latter were clear, and that there was nothing
but the purest atmosphere between the earth and the heavens.
Was it, then, the atmospherical matter which was thus illuminated,
and which, being ruffled by the breeze, can be supposed
to have really exhibited the appearances described by this
writer, or, was it not, rather, illuminated <em class="italic">auroral matter</em>,
which was shot through the atmosphere; and, if this last,
how are we to understand that its brilliance, and still less the
frequency and vigour of its coruscations, could have been
affected by the freshening of the breeze?</p>

<hr class="hr12pct" />

<p>X. But, taking, now, a final leave of the description of the
Aurora of the 25th of September, and of the observations
specially suggested by it, let us here examine the several particulars
which are commonly offered as part, at least, of its
true history; an undertaking, for the greater convenience of
which the account given in a modern work of much and
<span class="xxpn" id="p405">[p405]</span>
deserved reputation, shall be quoted and considered sentence
by sentence, as follows:</p>

<p>1. “<span class="smcaps">A<span>URORA</span></span>
<span class="smcaps">B<span>OREALIS</span></span>, <em class="italic">Northern Light</em>, or <em class="italic">Streamers</em>; a
kind of meteor, appearing in the Northern part of the heavens,
mostly in the winter time, and in frosty weather.</p>

<p>2. “It is in the Arctic regions that it appears in perfection,
particularly during the solstice.</p>

<p>3. “In the Shetland Islands, the Merry Dancers, as they
are called, are the constant attendants of clear evenings, and
prove great reliefs amidst the gloom of the long winter nights.</p>

<p>4. “They commonly appear at twilight, near the horizon,
of a dun colour, approaching to yellow; sometimes continuing
in that state, for several hours, without any sensible motion,
after which they break out into streams of stronger light,
spreading into columns, and altering slowly into ten thousand
different shapes, varying their colours from all the tints of
yellow to the obscurest russet.</p>

<p>5. “They often cover the whole hemisphere, and then make
the most brilliant appearance.</p>

<p>6. “Their motions, at these times, are most amazingly quick,
and they astonish the spectators with the rapid change of their
form.</p>

<p>7. “They break out in places where none were seen before,
skimming briskly along the heavens; are suddenly extinguished,
and leave behind a uniform dusky track.</p>

<p>8. “This again is brilliantly illuminated in the same manner,
and as suddenly left a dull blank.</p>

<p>9. “In certain nights, they assume the appearance of vast
columns; on one side of the deepest yellow, on the other, declining
away till it becomes undistinguished from the sky.</p>

<p>10. “They have generally a tremulous motion from end to
end, which continues till the whole vanishes.</p>

<p>11. “In a word, we, who only see the extremities of these
northern phenomena, have but a faint idea of their splendour
and their motions.</p>

<p>12. “According to the state of the atmosphere, they differ
in colour.</p>

<p>13. “They often put on the colour of blood, and then make
a most dreadful appearance<a id="fnanchor_124_88" href="#fn_124_88" class="fnanchor">124</a>.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p406">[p406]</span></p>

<p>1. Now, with respect to the first and second of the sentences
here transcribed, there seems reason to doubt the accuracy
of the account which almost limits the appearances of the
Aurora to the “winter time,” to “frosty weather,” and especially
to the winter “solstice.” The frequency with which the
season approaching to Christmas, or that of the winter solstice,
is distinguished by the occurrence of weather peculiarly mild,
insomuch that, almost every year, the period is marked by
observations upon what is annually called the extraordinary
and unseasonable genialness of the weather, cowslips blooming,
leaves budding, and birds building their nests; this frequency
of a mild temperature of the air about the period of the winter
solstice, may justify, even under a general view, a doubt of the
accuracy with which, as things of course, the winter solstice,
and frosty weather, are spoken of as arriving in conjunction.
But, that the appearance of the Aurora Borealis is not peculiar,
either to the occurrence of frosty weather, or to the period of
the winter solstice, whether the two latter phenomena are
related or otherwise, seems probable, as well from the mildness
of the weather at the late appearance, as from the various
seasons of the year in which the few others described in our
books are recorded to have presented themselves. The earliest
mentioned was seen in London in the year 1560, on the
30th day of January. The next was in 1564, on the 7th of
October. The next, in 1574, on the 14th and 15th of November.
The two next, observed in Brabant, in 1575, on the 25th of
February, and 28th of September. The next, at Wurtemburg,
as we are assured by Meestlin, seven times, in the year 1580.
The next, in an extraordinary manner, in the months of April
and September, 1581; and in a less degree, at some other
places, in the same year. The next, observed all over France,
in 1621, on the 2nd of September. The next in 1707,and
1708, during which two years the Aurora was witnessed five
times. The next, in the month of March, in 1715–16. The
next, in 1737, on the 16th of December; that seen in London
in 1791, of the month of which the writer is uninformed;
another in 1803, or 1804, at the latter of September, or the
beginning of October; and this, of 1827, on the 25th of September.
But, from these statements, it is now seen, that,
<span class="xxpn" id="p407">[p407]</span>
exclusive of appearances of the Aurora in respect of which
the month is not particularised, eight of the different months
of the year occur by name; that is to say, the months of
September, October, November, and December, January,
February, March, and April; leaving only four months (May,
June, July, and August, the identical summer-months of the
Polar regions, or months during which the sun visits the
Polar horizon!) hitherto undistinguished by the phenomenon
of the Aurora, and almost establishing, as the season of its
occurrence, not the middle point of the winter solstice, but
the whole period extending, in general terms, from the autumnal
equinox to the vernal, beginning at or before the
first, and ending at or after the last; or, what may be called
the entire winter of the northern hemisphere, or the period
during which the sun’s course is to the southward of the tropic
of Cancer; a deduction from the scanty data offered by such
archives of the phenomenon as we possess, not, perhaps, of
trifling importance toward the establishment of the true theory
of the cause, as well as of the purpose of its being.</p>

<p>2. The third sentence, where it describes the Aurora Borealis
as the <em class="italic">constant</em> attendant of clear evenings in the Shetland
Islands, and thereby a great relief to the gloom of the long
winter-nights, is probably tainted with errors in regard to the
phenomenon, such as affect its whole history and philosophy.
The suggestion has just been hazarded above, that at least
considerable displays of the Aurora are probably almost as
rare, even in the Arctic regions, as in climates further south;
and the truth of this persuasion, as the writer anticipates,
will fully appear below. In the sentence now referred to,
the word “constant” should, at least, give way to “frequent,”
if not to “often;” and a distinction should be allowed
for, between those feeble appearances which alone, it may be
suspected, are even <em class="italic">often</em> beheld in the Shetland Islands, and
those extraordinary displays which make themselves visible to
their southward.</p>

<p>3. The fourth of the above sentences, in which the Aurora is
said to appear commonly at twilight, will have been seen to
agree with the time assigned for the commencement of the
Aurora in the late example; and this, when coupled with the
<span class="xxpn" id="p408">[p408]</span>
observation in the third, that, in the Shetland Islands, it is the
constant attendant of <em class="italic">clear</em> evenings, will seem to suggest,
what, indeed, will probably be easily agreed to, that the Aurora,
in itself, is peculiar neither to clear evenings nor to
evenings at all; but is in activity during the twenty-four hours,
or without intermission; though, to be visible to human eyes,
first, the atmosphere must be dark, and, secondly, it must
be more or less clear. It may also be thought apparent,
from the terms of the twelfth and thirteenth sentences, that
too much has not been said by the present writer, of the
degree in which the peculiar spectacle, upon each separate
occasion, depends, not alone of the proper and really uniform
features of the Aurora itself, but also of the atmosphere
through which it is seen, with the appearance of which its
own appearance is combined; and of the consequent value
of a careful separation of the real phenomena of the Aurora,
from the adventitious phenomena of the intervening and surrounding
atmosphere. That the colours which, whether visibly
connected with the atmosphere or otherwise, are displayed during
the appearance of the Aurora Borealis, are wholly derived
from the atmospherical medium through which we behold it,
and that the Aurora itself exhibits only a pure white light, is
what the writer greatly inclines to suspect, and what may
seem to be rendered still more credible by that which is reported
by those who have obtained a partial glimpse of the
Aurora <em class="italic">Australis</em>, or corresponding phenomenon of the south.
This is described, by Mr. Forster, who sailed round the world
with Captain Cook, as consisting in “long columns of clear
white light;” but the whiteness, in the eyes of the narrator,
seemed to establish a difference, instead of a similitude, between
the Auroræ Australis and Borealis, Mr. F. wholly overlooking
the explanation which his own account supplies!
“These columns,” says he, “though in most respects similar
to the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) of our hemisphere,
yet differed from them in being always of a whitish colour,
whereas ours assume various tints, especially those of a fiery or
purple hue. The sky was generally clear when they appeared,
and the air sharp and cold, the thermometer standing at the
freezing point.” Now this text is its own commentary. The
<span class="xxpn" id="p409">[p409]</span>
Aurora could not have been seen if the sky had not been more
or less <em class="italic">clear</em>. But the sky was <em class="italic">very clear</em>; and this because the
weather was <em class="italic">severely frosty</em>. The thermometer “was standing
at the freezing point.” The weather was settled frosty, and
therefore settled clear; for the Aurora appeared for “several
following nights.” The atmosphere, therefore, was clear; there
was neither cloud nor fog, and thence the whiteness of the
Aurora. But these views of the Aurora <em class="italic">Australis</em> were partial
occurrences, and were characterised, as we must conclude, by
the state of the atmosphere at a particular conjuncture, or at a
particular season of the year. In point of fact, the Aurora was
seen on the 16th of February, 1773, in latitude 58°&#160;S. This
was the beginning of the Australian winter, and it might be a
very cold, and therefore a very clear beginning. But the atmosphere
of the southern half of the globe is not always thus
translucent; and when it is otherwise, we may depend upon it
that the columns of its Aurora “assume various colours; especially
those of a fiery and purple hue,” more or less like our own.
A friend of the present writer was in the same latitude
<span class="nowrap">(58° 12′ S.)</span>
in the month of March, a few years since; and, upon
asking that gentleman whether he had ever beheld an Aurora
in the Southern Hemisphere, his answer was in the negative.
The season of his visit, however, was a month later in the
southern winter than the visit of Messrs. Cook and Forster; the
weather was thick and sleety; it was unfavourable to any view
of an Aurora at all; but, had the phenomenon happened to
present itself, its appearance, we may believe, would not have
presented that of a uniform, clear, white light.</p>

<p>4. In the fourth and sixth sentences, what is said of “change
of shape,” and “change of form,” is of a nature exceedingly to
mislead such as, never having themselves witnessed the phenomenon,
may desire either to figure it to their imagination, or
to reason upon its appearances. In reality, there is no such
change of shape or form as the words naturally suggest to
our ideas; the forms, under all changes, are still linear; and
the actual changes, as to form, are limited to such changes only
as can be produced with the single material of lines, lengthened,
shortened, varied in their direction, and now fixed, now shaken,
now darting; and now joined in rapid and intermingling motion.
<span class="xxpn" id="p410">[p410]</span>
Add, that these lines are luminous, and varied in colour from
white to yellow, red, and crimson, and, sometimes, perhaps, to
purple and to violet; that they play, in the lower heavens in
a field of light, and in the upper over a sky of blue; and the
picture of the Aurora Borealis is well nigh complete. The observation
in the ninth sentence, that the vast columns, of which,
upon some occasions, the Aurora displays the forms, are of a
deep yellow upon one side, which, upon the other, fades gradually
into that of the sky, is to be understood, as expressing,
that, as in the late example, the outer edges of the columns,
or those next the dark or unillumined portion of the horizon,
are sharp and strongly defined; while the inner ones are less
distinguished from the general field of light in which they
stand; and which distinction, after all, is but a delusion of
the eye, which more readily distinguishes the variation of
colour in the outer edge, which is so strongly relieved by the
dark and colder-coloured part of the sky, than the colour of the
inner part and edge of the column, which, more or less, approaches
that of the ground behind it.</p>

<p>5. Sentences seven and eight appear to the present writer
to convey the most accurate description possible, of the appearance
of the Aurora in the <em class="italic">zenith</em>. The “dusky track,” which
remains after the lights which have enlivened it are extinguished,
and in which they are so often seen again, may seem to attest
the justice of his opinion, that these appearances in the zenith
are no other than the far-projected tops of the columns which
have their bases in, or rather below, the horizon; tops
which, while they fill the southern half of the zenith, to the
view of spectators under our parallel, must gradually descend
toward the horizon, in the eyes of such as behold them further
and still further to the south; till, like the topmast of a receding
ship, they first scarcely remain discoverable above the
convexity of the surface intervening, and finally dip and sink
beneath it. But, upon this assumption, the appearance, and
therefore office, of the Aurora Borealis, must be conceived as
extending far to the southward of even our own island; and
the statement, as in the eleventh sentence, becomes more or
less inaccurate, that “only the extremities of these northern
phenomena” are witnessed by ourselves. In reality we are
<span class="xxpn" id="p411">[p411]</span>
ourselves inhabitants of the Northern hemisphere; and the
relationship of the Aurora to the wants of the whole hemisphere
is more extended, perhaps, than we have commonly
imagined. It is even a contradiction to say, as in the eleventh
sentence, that we see only the extremities, that is, the
Southern extremities of these Northern phenomena, after
having said, in the fifth sentence, that “they often cover the
whole heavens, and then make the most brilliant appearance;”
unless, indeed, in both of these remarks reference is made to
the spectacle beheld under more Northerly parallels, a reference
which is further suggested, together with their apparent
origin, in the terms of a description by Gmelin, to be cited
below, of the Aurora as beheld upon the coasts of the Icy Sea;
If the Aurora, there, or upon the banks of the Lena or Yenesei,
is seen to rise in the north, but yet to stretch itself over the
whole hemisphere, it must follow, that its “extremities,” that
is, its southern extremities, so far from being all that is seen in
these situations, are really projected, on those occasions, so
far to the southward, as to escape the ken of our northern
optics; a fact of which the explanation must be familiar,
inasmuch as, owing to the convexity of the surface of the
globe, the horizon of every part is narrowly bounded, whether
upon the South or upon the North; whence it results, that
any celestial, or even atmospherical appearance, stretching
only a little way beyond us to the Southward, or toward the
East, or toward the West, must soon reach the horizon upon
either of those sides, and thus cover all that, to the eye
of any individual, is visible of the “whole hemisphere.”</p>

<p>6. But the description, by Gmelin, of the Aurora, as seen
upon the shores of the Icy Sea, and more than all, the simplicity
with which the naturalist is disposed to fix its birth-place
in that precise interval of the earth’s surface which divides the
mouth of the river Yenesei from that of the river Lena, in the
North-east of Asia, (a spot so far to the <em class="italic">North-eastward</em>, too, of
our own!) while it may possibly explain the origin or bearing
of remarks, that it “sometimes covers the whole hemisphere,
and then makes the most brilliant appearance,” will also
afford something of an answer to such as, with the writer
quoted above, seeking to connect the Aurora Borealis with the
<span class="xxpn" id="p412">[p412]</span>
Magnetic Pole, would discover its same birth-place, or focus,
in the <em class="italic">North-west</em>, or nearer to the North-west of America, than
to the North-east of Asia! It may furnish a reply, also, to
Gmelin himself, who, though he tells us that, even upon the
banks of the Lena and Yenesei, the Aurora is still seen to rise
to the North or North-east of those situations, yet imagines
those very banks to be its “real birth-place;” for is it not
plain, in the meantime, and this from the very statement of
the author, that, travel as far northward, or north-eastward, as
we will, the birth-place of the Aurora still retires from our
feet; that, even upon the shores of the Icy Sea, the joyous
phantom is still to our Northward, or North-east, and that we
may reasonably conclude, that even a voyage upon that sea
would not carry us to the cradle in pursuit; that, in short, at
the North Pole, we should still behold it rise in the North, or
the North-east, or the North-west; that we might sail down
the Western Hemisphere, and yet only discover, that the Aurora
was now in the North behind our backs, as it had been before
in the North before our faces; and that, in short, so long as
we do but admit its existence in the North, the particular soil
or sea is best described in the most general
<span class="nowrap">terms:—</span></p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="center">“In Nova Zembla, or the Lord knows where!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>The search, too, for the paternal hearth of the Aurora Borealis
in any particular division of the Northern Hemisphere, and
especially the attempt to find it at the Magnetic or Electric
Pole, is, perhaps, so much the more hopeless, after
ascertaining, as above, that each hemisphere has its Aurora;
and after concluding, as we may have been led to conclude
with reason, that each Aurora, other things equal, resembles
the other! What is remarkable, also, is that, in the Southern
Hemisphere, as well as, according to Gmelin, in the Northern,
it is to the Eastward, or to the East of North, that the Aurora
has its apparent focus. “A beautiful phenomenon,” says
Mr. Forster, (Feb. 17, 1773, lat. <span class="nowrap">58° S.)</span>
“had been observed
during the preceding night, which appeared again this and
several following nights. It consisted of long columns of white
light, shooting up from the horizon to the eastward, almost to
the zenith, and gradually spreading over the whole southern
part of the sky. These columns are gradually bent sideways
<span class="xxpn" id="p413">[p413]</span>
at their upper extremities; and, though in most respects similar
to the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) of our hemisphere,
yet differed from them in being always of a whitish colour;
whereas ours assume various colours, especially these of a fiery
or purple-hue. The sky was generally clear when they appeared,
and the air sharp and cold; the thermometer standing
at the freezing point.” This occasional bending of the
columns, “sideways at their upper extremities,” instead of
uniform convergence toward the zenith, observed by Mr.
Forster in the Aurora of the South, is plainly the same
peculiarity which was recently witnessed in London, in the
Aurora of the North, and a circumstance which, in whatever
way explained, assists in the identification of the natures
of the two phenomena; and, if we are still to hesitate,
upon account of the whiter light of that of the South, let us
believe that particular to originate in some peculiar constitution
of the Southern atmosphere, from which, in one way or
another, not here to be discussed, the cause of the difference
may offer itself. But Gmelin’s account of the Aurora of the
North, to which the attention of the reader has already been
called, is that which is here required to follow. It is to serve
to illustrate, as will be remembered, much of the foregoing:
“This Northern Light,” says that author, “begins with the
rising of single light pillars in the North, and almost at the same
time in the North-east, which, gradually increasing, fill a large
space in the heavens, rush about, from place to place, with
incredible velocity, and finally almost cover the whole sky, up
to the zenith: the streams are then seen meeting together in
the zenith, where they produce an appearance as if a vast tent
was expanded in the heavens, glittering with gold, rubies, and
sapphires. A more beautiful spectacle cannot be described;
but whoever should witness such a Northern Light for the first
time, could not behold it without terror; for, however beautiful
the illumination may be, it is attended, as I have learned from
the relation of many persons, with a hissing, crackling, and
rushing noise, throughout the air, as if the largest fireworks
were playing off. To describe what they then hear, they make
use of the expression, ‘Spolochi chodjat;’ that is, ‘The furious
army is passing!’ The hunters, who, upon the confines of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p414">[p414]</span>
Icy Sea, follow the chase of the blue and white foxes, are often
overtaken in their excursions by the Northern Light; and, upon
this occurrence, their dogs are so much frightened, that they
will not move, but cower obstinately upon the ground till the
noise is over. The weather, after the appearance of the
Northern Light, is usually clear and calm. I have heard these
accounts, not from one person only, but from many of those
who have spent several years in these very Northerly regions,
and inhabited different countries from the Yenesei to the
Lena, so that no doubt of its truth can remain; for here
seems to be the real birth-place of the Aurora Borealis.”</p>

<p>8. Upon this statement itself, it is only needful to remark,
that the rising of the pillars in the North-east, or to the East
of North, rather than to the North-west, or West of North,
almost at the same time with their first appearance in the
North, is not, perhaps, even as seen between the Lena and
Yenesei, so uniformly the case as M. Gmelin may have been
led to believe; and that, at all events, as above described, the
progress of the late display, observed in London, was, first from
North to West, and afterward from West to East; the North
being always the centre, or always light, while the West and
East were changed. The covering of the whole sky, and the
splendour of the scene produced, have been the subject of previous
remark; and the observation, “that the streams (previously
called pillars) are then seen meeting together in the
zenith,” entirely corroborates what the present writer has said of
the nature of the lights seen skimming across the zenith, and
across each other, and the deduction which he has thence made,
that the luminous appearances in the zenith are the summits
of those very pillars of which the bases are on or below the
horizon. The clear and calm weather which, on the shores of
the Icy Sea, commonly follows the appearance of the Aurora
is, in some degree, in concord with the phenomena of its
recent appearance in London; where, without any material
change in the temperature, a succession of clear, calm, and
bright days supervened, within a day or two of the Aurora.
As to the hissing, crackling, or rushing noise, which is said
to accompany the Aurora in the more northern regions, and
which has sometimes been compared to that of the furling and
<span class="xxpn" id="p415">[p415]</span>
unfurling of flags, there is nothing difficult, (knowing what we
do of the noise of winds and of thunder,) in admitting its probability,
unless what may arise from the consideration, that
the noise might, or might not, be expected to be heard, where-ever
the phenomenon is to be seen. But the most striking
and important truth, communicated in the foregoing account, is
that which we cannot but rigorously infer from the collective
testimony of two very distinct descriptions, which is afforded
in two of the concluding sentences. It consists in that
real <em class="italic">infrequency</em>, as well in the Northern, as in the Southern
Hemisphere, of the appearance of the Aurora; an <em class="italic">infrequency</em>
the knowledge of which is so essential to the true history of
the phenomenon, and therefore to its true philosophy, and
consequently to much of the history and philosophy of nature
at large;—an <em class="italic">infrequency</em> which the present writer has given
notice of above, as a proposition for which, in dissent from all
received authorities, he will contend; and upon the opposite
account of which matter, in the general account quoted, he
has already requested the reader to suspend his judgment. It
is obvious that, as a natural phenomenon, an Aurora Borealis,
which, though <em class="italic">constantly</em> experienced in the more Northerly
regions, is but rarely observed in the more Southern; that is,
an Aurora Borealis which, though familiar to the Samoiede,
the Laplander, and even the Shetlander, is an extraordinary,
and a terrific, or at least a marvellous event, to the Italian, the
Frenchman, and even to the Englishman; it is obvious, that
such an Aurora Borealis, <em class="italic">constant</em> in its occurrence a little
further to the Northward, and almost the solitary spectacle of a
generation a little further to the South, is, as a natural phenomenon,
a very different thing from an Aurora Borealis
which, though far enough to the South, sufficiently frequent in
comparatively trivial magnitudes and lustre, is seen, either in
the South or in the North, in its greatness, and in its splendour,
but yet rarely, and with, perhaps, almost equal rareness; it is
obvious that, as natural phenomena, and not less so as sights
connected by mankind with their own fortunes, the two things
now described are exceedingly unlike as matter of history, and
equally so as matter of philosophy. If we are simply to record
the occurrence, it is one thing to speak of a phenomenon
<span class="xxpn" id="p416">[p416]</span>
which, in the South, is seen only at long intervals, while it is a
“constant attendant” in the North; and another thing to
speak of that which, whether in the South or in the North, is
equally rare, and equally out of the “constant” course of nature.
If we are to write the history of nature, it is one thing
to relate, that such phenomena, or rather others, infinitely more
splendid, more terrific, or more marvellous, than that which
was witnessed in London, in the month of September in this
year, or in the same month some three-and-twenty years ago,
or else some six-and-thirty, and, to judge by experience, is
not to be looked for, in the same city, during twenty or thirty
years again;—it is one thing to relate that, in the Shetland
Islands, such a spectacle is a “constant attendant of clear
evenings,” and another thing to relate, that though, perhaps,
on clear evenings, in the Shetland Islands, some small displays
of the Aurora are not unfrequently perceived, yet, that
such an exhibition as has recently been witnessed in London,
and still more, such as, more effulgent, and more extended,
and more vigorous, and even coloured by the atmosphere
into the terrific;—that those exhibitions, in short, of which
our naturalists and men of science would persuade us, that,
while beheld nightly by those of the North, they are known
to us by very faint examples alone;—those exhibitions,—that
those extraordinary examples of the brightness and vigour of the
Aurora—are as rare, or almost as rare, not only in the Shetland
Islands, but in Iceland, and on the shores of the Icy Sea,
as in the streets of London themselves! It is obvious, too,
that if we are to speak of this phenomenon philosophically,
if we are to attempt to explain its origin and use,—its source
in the natural elements, and its office in the natural economy;
here, too, the solving of this question of the <em class="italic">frequency</em> or <em class="italic">infrequency</em>,
the <em class="italic">constancy</em> or the <em class="italic">inconstancy</em>, of these mighty
exhibitions, even in the North, and under the Pole itself, is
matter of foremost importance. And what is the testimony,
upon these heads, which is borne by the accounts collected by
Gmelin? Is the Northern Light of the German naturalist,
the apparently constant attendant of clear evenings, even in the
countries between the Lena and the Yenesei? Is the spectacle,
and the atmospherical hurley, which seems to rush over the
<span class="xxpn" id="p417">[p417]</span>
hunting-grounds of the hunters and their dogs, and which
frightens the very dogs, and pins them to the ground till it is
passed, or has seemed to pass; is this the “constant attendant
of clear evenings,” or, is it a prodigy so uncommon as to defy
familiarity? But, if this evidence is insufficient, let us look to
what is said of its influence, in these countries, on the subsequent
state of the atmosphere. So far from the Aurora being
an attendant or follower of clear evenings, it seems that clear
evenings follow the Aurora! It is said, that after its occurrence,
clear and calm weather is customary to follow; and,
here, the expression itself is implicative of the rarity of the
occurrence. If it were constant, how should this result come
to be noticed; and, indeed, if the Aurora Borealis were the
constant attendant of each twenty-four hours, and if clear
weather were usually in the train of the Aurora Borealis, how
could it ordinarily happen, that there should be any thing else
than clear weather, in the countries visited by the Aurora, or
any foul weather for the Aurora to dispel? Yet, such is the
established prejudice concerning this supposed frequency
of the more powerful displays of the Aurora in the climates
further to the North than our own, that a writer, quoting the
very statement above, absolutely prefaces it with the remark,
that Gmelin, in pointed terms, speaks of the Aurora as “frequent,”
as well as “very loud,” “in the North-eastern parts
of Siberia<a id="fnanchor_125_89" href="#fn_125_89" class="fnanchor">125</a>!” A simple perusal, in the meantime, is sufficient
to show, that Gmelin says nothing affirmative as to its <em class="italic">frequency</em>;
while a slight consideration of the facts which he
adduces must satisfy us, as no doubt they satisfied Gmelin
himself, that the occurrence, even in Siberia, is actually <em class="italic">infrequent</em>!</p>

<hr class="hr12pct" />

<p><span class="allcaps">XI</span>. In reference, however, as well to the image presented
above, of “a vast tent expanded in the heavens, glittering
with gold, rubies, and sapphires;” as also to many less
ambitious and figurative descriptions of the spectacle of the
Aurora Borealis, (not excepting that indicted by himself,)
the author is anxious to suggest a caution against the too
exaggerated conception of the realities intended. Words,
<span class="xxpn" id="p418">[p418]</span>
upon such occasions, are rarely more than imperfect pictures,
presenting but feeble likenesses, and either deficient
or excessive in the amount of beauty, or of the reverse, of
whatever kind, which they attempt to copy from their originals;
and the inconvenience is seriously great, whenever the object
portrayed is wholly strange to the mind before which it is placed.
The imperfect power, both of words and written characters,
to convey precise, and sometimes even tolerable ideas, of
the objects, either sensible or abstract, which they are intended
to represent, and the superior intelligibility so often belonging
to diagrams or figures, or other resources of the art of drawing,
(the primitive, and, for so many purposes, the most instructive
mode of writing<a id="fnanchor_126_90" href="#fn_126_90" class="fnanchor">126</a>,) would have led the present writer, had
time permitted, to endeavour, as often as possible, to elucidate
by such means the several parts of the foregoing
observations; but which means, at last, and in reference to the
actual phenomena of the Aurora, would necessarily fail to
convey the due, and yet no more than the due impression, to
such as are wholly without its ocular acquaintance. We are
little aware how much, upon ordinary occasions, our understanding
of words heard or read is assisted by our previous
knowledge of the sensible objects, or of the acquired notions,
to which they refer; and the examples would be endless, of
the sensible objects preposterously misconceived, as well as
the propositions made false or ridiculous, through the frequent
inadequacy of words to communicate truths entirely new
<span class="xxpn" id="p419">[p419]</span>
to the disciple. Even the history of opinions concerning the
Aurora Borealis itself, might be cited upon this very point.</p>

<p>The ordinary and natural resource, in such circumstances, is
comparison; but even comparison has been the source of
great and endless errors of description. Of the degree of
resemblance proposed between the known and the unknown,
there is no common measure for the minds of the hearer and the
listener, and the point or points of comparison intended by
the first must often be mistaken by the second; or, if reference
is made to a similitude under one aspect, the imagination
conceives a resemblance also under another: thus, if it is
said, that an unknown animal is as <em class="italic">large</em> as a horse, the idea of
the <em class="italic">figure</em> also of a horse, is apt to be attached. A modern
English work of science premises, upon the subject of the
Aurora Borealis, that its appearance is so well known as to
render description needless. It is true that the work referred
to is printed in the Northern part of the island, where the phenomenon
is doubtless more familiar than in the Southern; but,
in the foregoing pages themselves, it has, perhaps, been demonstrated
as probably certain, that if it is any where sufficiently
known to render description trite for the common eye,
it has at least never hitherto been described with sufficient precision
for the aid of speculative research. To attempt to explain
its <em class="italic">cause</em>, and to relate its entire history, its <em class="italic">appearance</em>
must first be either observed or described with accuracy; and
we have seen, above, that some of the most scientific reasonings
which have hitherto been offered as to the former, are
wholly inapplicable to the true peculiarities of the latter.</p>

<p>Considered simply as a visual object, and as a meteor
differing from all others, and especially from all other luminous
meteors, in this, that its duration extends to hours, if not to
days and months; the only resemblance, perhaps, that can be
suggested, is to that description of lightning which is called <em class="italic">heat-lightning</em>,
the frequent companion of our summer-evenings.
But, here, the similitude is inexpressibly feeble; since heat-lightning
has nothing, either of the splendour, the volume, or
the beauty of the Aurora; and since the light of the latter,
however mobile, varied, and, from time to time, increased and
diminished in itself, is yet, as to general effect, continuous and
<span class="xxpn" id="p420">[p420]</span>
steady. There remains, then, but to compare the phenomenon
of the Aurora with the rising or the setting Sun. In both of
these latter, as in the Aurora, the light is in the horizon, and
that light is shot upward, perpendicularly, or obliquely,
toward the zenith or toward the right and left; and both of
these, like the Aurora, are more or less constantly attended with
a variety of colouring, similar in hue if not in depth, and
always beautiful, and often gorgeous. With the <em class="italic">Sun</em>, and
with the beams of the Sun, ancient description, in point of
fact, has confounded the <em class="italic">Aurora Borealis</em>, to the degree, perhaps,
of giving origin to some of the ancient and poetical
descriptions of the Sun, utterly inappropriate and inexplicable
as understood of that day-star, but easily recognised in the Aurora;
yet the dissimilitudes, at last, are numerous and great!
Of the essential difference of figure, both as to the <em class="italic">beams</em> of the
Sun, and the <em class="italic">beams</em> of the Aurora, in severalty, and of the inevitable
difference of indication of which, as to their nature,
mention has been already made; and also as to the general or
collective figure of the beams of the Aurora, as contrasted with
that of the rising, or of the setting Sun. The next point is the
homogeneity of colour in the beams of the Sun, however the
apparent colour may vary, as it is seen to do, from horizontal
stratum to horizontal stratum, from the horizon to the zenith,
according to the varied density of the medium between the
light and the eye of the spectator. The light, upon the
other hand, of the beams of the Aurora is heterogeneously
coloured in itself, and is so displayed; and not, therefore,
varied as the beams ascend from horizontal stratum to horizontal
stratum, or as crossing all the beams together, but
found in each particular beam itself, and attending its
direction, whether vertical or inclined, and whether rectilinear
or curved. Waiving, then, any comparison in detail,
between the phenomena of the Aurora, and the phenomena of
the rising or of the setting Sun, but admitting that, to a certain
degree, all are alike vast in dimensions, splendid in light, rich
in colour, and durable upon the eye; there is still nothing else
to be subjoined, than that, at least with reference to vastness of
dimension and magnitude of the volume of light; to the quantity
of light diffused; and to the richness and gorgeousness of
<span class="xxpn" id="p421">[p421]</span>
the attendant colouring; there can be little risk, in the assertion
that, vast, and splendid, and beautiful, and rich, and gorgeous,
as, when seen in the most favourable situation, and
under the most favourable circumstances, the Aurora may be,
it is, at last, but insignificant, when compared, for those features,
to the vastness, the splendour, the beauty, the richness,
and the gorgeousness, more or less, from day to day, displayed
in the rising or the setting of the Sun; and, that for chaster
beauty, and even for amount of light diffused, it is not even to
be likened to the silver Moon! As a substitute, too, for either,
or for both, the Aurora, in the regions of cold and night, may
justly demand the admiration and the blessing of mankind;
and, in regions cold and inclement, its rarity, not unaccompanied
by beauty, by grandeur, and sometimes even by the
terrible in appearance, may well invite the gaze and fix the
attention of beholders; but, considered along with the light of
the luminaries of heaven, its claims reduce themselves in
quality, though certainly not in degree, to a level with those of
an artificial lustre; and we almost repeat, in reference to the
light of the Aurora, as compared with that of the Sun, or even
of the Moon, what the poet has said in reference to the lights
of our
<span class="nowrap">chambers:—</span></p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="iplus4">“Who but rather turns</p>
<p>To heaven’s broad beam his unconstrained eye,</p>
<p>Than to the glimmering of a waxen flame?”</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Moon, in the meantime, inferior as she is to the Sun,
has been “blessed,” from age to age, for her “useful light;”
and the “useful light” of the Aurora, also, has its claims to
“blessing.” It co-operates with the Sun, the Moon, and with
other agents of nature, to make, not merely the Polar regions
of the earth, but the entire globe of the earth, fruitful, at once,
and habitable<a id="fnanchor_127_91" href="#fn_127_91" class="fnanchor">127</a>!

<p><span class="allcaps">XII</span>. In a succeeding paper, the author may possibly
submit to the consideration of his reader, the particular and
novel hypotheses which he has allowed himself to form, as
to the <em class="italic">substance</em>, <em class="italic">causes</em>, and <em class="italic">effects</em> of the Aurora; hypotheses
partly dependent upon those <em class="italic">facts in its natural history</em>,
which, above, have been almost the exclusive objects of attention.
At present, the leading particulars of the <em class="italic">natural history</em>
of the phenomenon, which it has been attempted either to
bring or to fix in view, are these:</p>

<p>1. That the Aurora is a phenomenon observed both in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres.</p>

<p>2. That, in either hemisphere, it is observed in the general
direction of the corresponding <em class="italic">pole of the earth</em>.</p>

<p>3. That, in the Northern Hemisphere, on the shores of the
Icy Sea, or at the furthest distance north, its situation is still
observed to be the northward.</p>

<p>4. That, in the Southern Hemisphere, it has been observed to
the east of the South Pole, and in the Northern, to the east
and west of the North Pole.</p>

<p>5. That, upon the late occasion, the place of its columns,
during the exhibition, was observed to change from the west
of north to the east of north; but, so as always to have the
north for the apparent centre of its strength.</p>

<p>6. That, in the Arctic regions, the appearance of the Aurora
is said to be usually followed by clear and calm weather.</p>

<p>7. That the appearance of the Aurora Borealis is no wise
peculiar to the winter solstice, but has been observed in each of
the eight months of September, October, November, December,
January, February, March, and April, and may be regarded,
therefore, as coincident with the Arctic winter; and that the
appearance of an Aurora in the Southern Hemisphere, in the
month of February, or beginning of the Antarctic winter, as observed
during the voyage of Captain Cook, in the year 1773, is
<span class="xxpn" id="p423">[p423]</span>
consistent with the persuasion, that the Aurora <em class="italic">Australis</em>, in
its turn, is a phenomenon of the Austral or Antarctic winter.</p>

<p>8. That <em class="italic">considerable</em> or powerful displays of the Aurora are
infrequent, even in the extreme Polar regions; and that it is
<em class="italic">very considerable</em> or powerful displays alone, which make themselves
visible in the lower latitudes, north or south of the
equator.</p>

<p>9. That no appearance belongs to the Aurora itself, but that
of its coruscations, columns, spears, or streamers; and that
all colours, therefore, or coloured figures, not belonging to the
coruscations, but coincident in their appearance, are to be
regarded only as reflections or refractions of light, derived
from the coruscations by the clouds which happen to cover the
sky.</p>

<p>10. That the colours, or coloured light, proper to the Aurora,
or seen in the columns or coruscations themselves, are varied
from column or coruscation to column or coruscation, and
severally continued in the direction, and throughout the length
or height, of each.</p>

<p>11. That, in the late example, the columns or coruscations
situate in the due north, or apparent centre or focus of the phenomenon,
exhibited a light at least comparatively white; and
that the variation, from white to colour, had an apparent
relation to the comparative remoteness of each column or
coruscation from the column or coruscation in the central
north.</p>

<p>12. That the direction or position of the columns or coruscations
of the Aurora, are so far from being uniformly convergent
toward the zenith, or uniformly vertical, or from the
horizon to the zenith, that, in the late example, they <em class="italic">did not
converge</em> toward the zenith, but, contrariwise, <em class="italic">diverged</em> from it;
spreading themselves like the sticks of a fan, or like stalks in a
flower-basket.</p>

<p>13. That the columns or coruscations of the Aurora are not
uniformly rectilinear in their figure; but that, in the late example,
those on the north-eastward were curved outwardly,
or “bent sideways,” as described in the appearance of the
columns or coruscations of an Aurora seen in the Southern
Atlantic, during the voyage of Captain Cook, in the year 1773.</p>

The individual, social, and political importance of
making the <em class="italic">art of drawing</em> a branch of general education, is a
subject which the author can never cease to urge upon the attention
of his fellow-countrymen, and of all the civilised world. It is more
than ten years since he first endeavoured to lead the public eye
to its regard. In England, and with a view to the subsistence of a
large and always increasing population, it is an
<span class="smcaps">E<span>DUCATION</span></span>
<span class="smmaj">IN THE</span>
<span class="smcaps">A<span>RTS</span></span> which is the great want; and the <em class="italic">art of drawing</em>, besides
being the assistant of all <em class="italic">knowledge</em> whatever, is peculiarly so of
all other <em class="italic">arts</em> than itself, or of all other works of the <em class="italic">hand</em>.
A recent Sermon, by the Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells, preached at
Wells, for the benefit of the Diocesan National Schools, bears ample
testimony to the deficiency, and even the dangers, to the poor not
less than to others, in all the present popular education; and, so
far, therefore, to the soundness of the author’s principles, and to
the fitness of his remedy. His own design, however, is not only to
remedy an evil arising from the present practice, but also to produce
an independent good; and, not merely to aid the poor, nor merely to
promote the political welfare of this kingdom, but to increase the
resources, physical and intellectual, of all classes, and to promote
the welfare of the whole world.</p>

The author has an opinion, that among the “agents of
nature,” for equalising the temperature of the surface of the globe,
is to be reckoned, not only the Northern and Southern Lights, but the
entire Ocean; and that this agency is the immediate object aimed at
in the existence of this last, as one body of water surrounding the
entire globe. His evidence consists in geographical, hydrographical,
meteorological, and physiological facts, as also in the apparent
reason of the case. He supposes, in consequence, a perpetual
circulation of the waters of the sea, longitudinally round the globe,
or from North to South, and from South to North again; and the result
of Captain Parry’s late attempt to reach the Arctic Pole, as also
some of the facts which have transpired respecting Captain Franklin’s
late land expedition, appear to confirm
his theory, according to which the physical use, or
final cause, of the existence of the Ocean has never previously
been understood. His theory affects the question of the North-west
Passage, which latter object he suspects to have never yet been
pursued in the true direction; even the discoveries of Captain
Parry appearing to him to have fallen short of ascertaining
the communication with the Polar Sea by the channel of Davis’s
Strait.—Some introductory observations upon this subject have been
already made in an article in the New Monthly Magazine for October,
1826, (vol. xvii. p. 371.)</p>

<p class="first"><span class="smcaps">T<span>HE</span></span>
anniversary meeting of the Royal Society for the election
of a president, and other officers, was held as usual at Somerset
House, on Thursday, the 30th of November, being St.
Andrew’s day.</p>

<p>Till within a few days of the election, it was generally understood
that the Rt. Hon. Robert Peel was a candidate for
the chair; in consequence, however, of that gentleman having
declined, Davies Gilbert, Esq., M.P., was put in nomination,
and was almost unanimously elected the President of the
Royal Society.</p>

<p>The late secretaries, Messrs. Herschel and Children, having
resigned their respective offices, Dr. Roget and Captain Sabine
were nominated in their places, and were duly elected.</p>

<p>The accession of Mr. Gilbert to the chair having rendered
vacant the office of Treasurer, Major Kater was elected in his
place.</p>

<p>The following council was elected, to continue in office
until St. Andrew’s day, 1828.</p>

<p>In consequence of having been elected President <em class="italic">pro tempore</em>
by the council, (the chair having been vacated some weeks
previous to the general election,) the duties of the office were
performed by Mr. Gilbert, on occasion of the present anniversary.
After having read over the list of members admitted,
and of those deceased during the last year, he proceeded to
announce the disposal of the Royal and Copley Medals, as
awarded by the votes of the council.</p>

<p>Of the Royal Medals, one was awarded to Sir H. Davy,
and the other to Professor Struve. Of the Copley Medals,
one was given to Dr. Prout, and another to Lieutenant Forster.
On this occasion Mr. Gilbert pronounced an eulogium upon
the respective receivers of the medals; and, in adverting to the
labours of the several individuals, he justified the decision
of the council, in bestowing upon them these marks of distinction,
in a learned and eloquent discourse.</p>

<h3><em class="italic">Proceedings of the Horticultural Society</em>. <a href="#jpart2">◊</a></h3>

<h4><em class="italic">September</em> 4th.</h4>

<p class="first">A
<span class="smmaj">PAPER</span>
by Mr. Lindley was read upon the new hardy plants
which had flowered in the Society’s garden; among them a
number of new shrubs were mentioned, which appeared likely
to prove acquisitions to the public. A thermometer was exhibited
by Mr. Bregazzi, of Derby, for ascertaining the temperature
of bark-beds. It consisted of a thermometer enclosed in a
shaft of copper with a wooden handle, and a door in its side,
by which the temperature can be ascertained with precision.
It is needless to point out the superiority of this plan, over the
common mode of determining this very essential point, by
feeling of a stick previously stuck in the bed; the sensation of
heat when the stick is grasped in the hand will obviously
depend in a great degree upon the temperature of the hand
itself. As usual, there was an extensive display of all the
choicest flowers and fruit of the season. One hundred and
seventy-two subjects of this description were placed upon the
table. Among the flowers, the most remarkable was a new
hardy climber from Mexico, with deep purple blossoms studded
<span class="xxpn" id="p426">[p426]</span>
with glittering green glands, called Maurandya Barclaiana;
among the fruit was a fine specimen, from Lord Grantham’s
garden, of the Papaw, a tropical fruit never ripened in England
before.</p>

<h4><em class="italic">September</em> 18th.</h4>

<p>The exhibitions of this day were chiefly confined to a display
of Dahlias, which for magnificence exceeded any thing of the
kind we ever witnessed before. The large meeting-room was
filled with masses of the richest and most lively colours. In
the whole, eight hundred and fifty-one varieties were shown,
among which the finest were from the garden of William Wells,
Esq., of Redleaf; but where all are so excellent, it is almost
invidious to particularize. The time will be remembered by
many of our readers when gardens in the autumn contained
little besides marigolds, sun-flowers, and sweet-peas; by the
aid of dahlias and chrysanthemums the autumn has now become
the liveliest season of the year, and the beauty of the
flower-garden is only destroyed by the severest of the winter
frosts. Among the grapes upon the table was a remarkably
excellent yellow-berried kind, from Portugal, from the garden
of Mr. Holford, of Hampstead, which was quite new to
this country. Apples, nectarines, peaches, and pine-apples
abounded.</p>

<h4> <em class="italic">October</em> 2nd. </h4>

<p>Among the flowers was a fine bunch of ranunculuses, from
Mr. Groom, of Walworth, a rare sight in October; they were
obtained by having been planted in July and carefully protected
by tulip-shades when coming into flower. The season for
softer fruits being nearly over, pears and apples formed the chief
display; of these a vast number, upwards of one hundred and
eighty of the latter, were upon the table: the Blenheim orange,
or Woodstock pippin, pomme gris, scarlet nonpareil, courtpendu
plat, golden reinette, and packhorse apples; and Chapman’s,
Marie Louise, and brown beurré pears, appeared to us
to excel all their rivals. The famous gloux morceau and
beurré d’Aremberg pears were also exhibited, but were not
ripe. <span class="xxpn" id="p427">[p427]</span></p>

<h4><em class="italic">October</em> 16th.</h4>

<p>The first number of a new periodical work, called the <em class="italic">Pomological
Magazine</em>, consisting of coloured figures of the fruits
cultivated in Great Britain, was placed upon the table. Among
the apples were specimens of a variety sent from England
to Connecticut, in the year 1636, and reimported from America
within a few years. It proved to be a kind not known at the
present day in this country, but still cultivated in France. In
the gardening books of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
it is mentioned under the name of the haute bonté. The
specimens exhibited served to disprove the opinion that many
of the American apples are European kinds altered by climate;
these, although the produce of trees which have been growing
in America for nearly two hundred years, differed in no respect
from French samples exhibited at a subsequent meeting of the
Society.</p>

<h4><em class="italic">November</em> 6th.</h4>

<p>An excellent paper was read upon the method of cultivating
horse radish, in Denmark. The roots are cut into slips, and
planted <em class="italic">horizontally</em>, the lower end inclining a little upwards,
and the crown of the plant hanging over the alleys, by which
the beds are separated. From time to time the roots are uncovered,
and all the <em class="italic">lateral</em> fibres are carefully removed, by
which the size and length of the roots are much increased.
The place hitherto occupied by dahlias, was now taken by
Chinese chrysanthemums, of which a large number, consisting
of twenty-two different varieties, was exhibited at the bottom of
the room.</p>

<h4><em class="italic">November</em> 20th.</h4>

<p>Cuttings of the fine new Portugal grape, of which fruit was
exhibited on the 18th of September, were distributed to the
members present. A few dahlia flowers still showed themselves,
notwithstanding the unusual severity of some early frosts, and
the room was crowded with chrysanthemums. The gloux morceau
and beurré d’Aremberg pears were tasted, and found to
retain the station which has been assigned to them at the head
of all known varieties. <span class="xxpn" id="p428">[p428]</span></p>

<p>The opposition to the sun will be 1828, Oct. 12.34: while its

<p>On the 10th of Nov. 1828, its distance from the sun will be the
same as at the time of its discovery in 1818, and it will be considerably
nearer to the earth; and on the 21st of December, its position
with respect to the sun will be the same as at its last observation
in 1819; and with respect to earth, its situation will be more
advantageous. The 1st of January, 1829, it will set with the sun.</p>

<p>It follows, that the most advantageous time for seeing it will be
during the whole of November, and the first 25 days of December.
It will scarcely be seen before the end of September, as it has heretofore
never been observed more than two months before the time of
its perihelion, and even in the dark winter nights will scarcely be
visible more than 14 or 15 weeks before that period. After the perihelion

order to complete the explanation of the conditions necessary
for the formation of the fringes, it remains to show why
a small luminous point must be employed in experiments on
diffraction, and not an object of any considerable dimensions.
If we resume the case of the interior fringes of the shadow of
<span class="xxpn" id="p432">[p432]</span>
a narrow body, it will be easy to apply similar arguments to
other cases of diffraction.</p>

<p>The middle of the central band, which is always formed by
the simultaneous arrival of rays, which depart at the same
instant from the luminous point, must be found in the plane
drawn through this point, and the line bisecting the narrow
body: because, since every thing is symmetrical on each
side of this plane, the rays which unite in it must have passed
through equal routes on each side, and must consequently
arrive at the same instant, unless they have passed through
different media, which is not the case to be considered at
present. The situation of the middle stripe being determined,
that of every other stripe must also be determined
accordingly. Now it is evident that if the luminous point
should change its situation a little, and be moved to the
right, for example, the plane, which has been supposed,
would incline to the left, and would carry with it all the
fringes which accompany the middle stripe. And if, instead
of supposing motion, we suppose the luminous point
to become of sensible dimensions; the integral points of
which it is composed will each produce a group of fringes,
and their situations will be so much the more remote as the
luminous object is larger; and ultimately, if its size is sufficiently
increased, they will extinguish each other and disappear.
This is the reason that, when the rays cross each other
at sensible angles, as in all the phenomena of diffraction, it
becomes necessary to employ a very fine luminous point, in
order to discover their mutual influence: and the point must
be so much the finer as the angle formed by the rays is
greater.</p>

<p>However minute the luminous point may be, it is always
composed, in reality, of an infinite number of centres of oscillations,
and it is of each of these centres that we must understand
what has been said of a luminous point. But as long
as they are very near to each other in comparison with the
breadth of the fringes, it is obvious that the different groups
of fringes which they produce, instead of mixing with each
other in a confused manner, will be superposed almost exactly,
and instead of extinguishing, will co-operate with each
other.
<span class="xxpn" id="p433">[p433]</span></p>

<p>When the two systems of waves which interfere are parallel,
the interval which separates their corresponding points
must remain the same for a great portion of the <em class="italic">surface of
the waves</em>, that is to say, in other words, the fringes will
become almost infinite in breadth, so that a very considerable
displacement of the centre of undulation will cause very
little difference in the agreement or disagreement of their
vibrations. And in this case it is no longer necessary to
employ so small an object in order to perceive the effects of
their mutual influence.</p>

<p>If the coloured rings, which are produced by the interference
of two systems of undulations nearly parallel, exhibit,
like the fringes, and often within a very short distance, alternations
of dark and bright stripes; this circumstance depends
entirely on the want of uniformity in the thickness of the
plate of air interposed between the glasses, which causes a
variation of the difference of the routes of the rays reflected
at the first and at the second surface of this plate, of which
the mutual interference produces the bright and dark rings.</p>

<p>We shall readily be able, to understand why the luminous
rays, although they always exert a certain influence on each
other, exhibit it to the eye so seldom, and in cases so much
limited, if we consider that it is necessary, for such an exhibition,
first, that the rays concerned shall have been derived
from a common source; secondly, that the difference between
their paths shall amount to a limited number of undulations
only, even when the light is as homogeneous as possible;
thirdly, that they shall not intersect each other at too great
an angle, because the fringes would become so small as to be
invisible even with the assistance of a strong magnifier;
and fourthly, unless the rays are nearly parallel, that the
luminous object should be of very small dimensions, and the
smaller in proportion as the inclination of the rays is greater.</p>

<p>It has been thought necessary to insist so much at length
on the theory of interferences, because of its numerous
applications to the calculation of the most interesting of
the laws of optical phenomena. These considerations may
perhaps appear at first somewhat delicate and difficult of
comprehension, notwithstanding the minuteness of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p434">[p434]</span>
explanation; but with some reflection it will be found that nothing
can be simpler than the principles on which they are founded,
and their application will soon become familiar to the imagination.</p>

<p>In order to complete the bases of the general theory of
diffraction, it remains for us to consider the principle of
Huygens, which appears to be a rigorous consequence of the
system of undulations.</p>

<p>The principle may be thus expressed: <em class="italic">The vibrations of a
luminous undulation, in each of its points, may be regarded
as the result of the elementary motions which would be transmitted
to that point, at the same instant, from all the points
of the undulation, considered separately, as they existed in
any one of its earlier situations</em>.</p>

<p>It is a consequence of the principle of the co-existence of
small motions, that the vibrations, produced at any point of
an elastic fluid, by several agitations, are represented by the
result of all the velocities belonging to that point at the same
instant, as derived from the different centres of the undulations,
combined according to the laws of motion, whatever
may be the number and situation of the centres, and whatever
the periods and nature of the undulations. This general
principle is applicable to every particular case. We may
suppose the agitations infinite in number, of the same kind,
simultaneous, and taking place in contiguous points of a
plane or a spherical surface: it will also be convenient to suppose
the motions of the particles to take place in the same
direction, perpendicular to the surface, their velocity being
proportional to the condensation of the medium, and none of
them retrograde in their direction. In this manner a derivative
undulation will be produced by the union of these agitations,
and the principle of Huygens may be truly applied
to such a propagation. [This may be called a rigorous
consequence of the system, but it can scarcely be considered
as a proposition mathematically demonstrated: and the fundamental
law of Huygens must perhaps be assumed as an
axiom or a phenomenon.
<span class="smcaps">T<span>R.</span></span>]</p>

<p>The intensity of the primitive undulation being uniform
throughout the surface, it results from this “theoretical”
<span class="xxpn" id="p435">[p435]</span>
consideration, as well as from other reasoning, that the uniformity
will be preserved throughout the progress of the
undulation, unless any part of it be intercepted or retarded;
because the result of the elementary motions, which have been
mentioned, will be the same for all the points. But if a portion
of the undulation be intercepted by the interposition of
an opaque body, then the intensity of each part will vary
according to the distance from the margin of the shadow, and
these variations will be particularly sensible in the neighbourhood
of the tangent rays.</p>

<div class="figc-s4">
<img src="images/i435.jpg" width="348" height="497" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Let C be the luminous point, <span class="allcaps">AG</span> the screen, and <span class="allcaps">AME</span>
the wave, arrived at A, and partly intercepted by the opaque
body. We may suppose it to be divided into an infinite
number of small arcs, A<em class="italic">m′</em>, <em class="italic">m′</em><em class="italic">m</em>, <em class="italic">m</em>M,
M<em class="italic">n″</em>, <em class="italic">n″</em><em class="italic">n′</em>, <em class="italic">n′</em><em class="italic">n</em>, and
so forth. In order to find its intensity at the point P, belonging
to any subsequent situation of the undulation, <span class="allcaps">BPD</span>,
we must find the result of all the elementary agitations
which each of these portions of the primitive undulation
would produce there if they acted separately.</p>

<p>The impulse, which has been given to every part of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p436">[p436]</span>
primitive undulation, being perpendicular to its surface, the
motions of the particles of ether in this direction must be
more considerable than in any other; and the rays depending
on these motions, if separately considered, would be so
much the weaker as they deviated the more from this direction.</p>

<p>The investigation of the law by which their intensity would
be governed, according to their direction, as derived from
any separate centre of agitation, would certainly be of very
difficult investigation: but happily we are not obliged to
determine this law, for it is easy to see that when the inclination
to the perpendicular is considerable, the effects of the
different rays must very nearly destroy each other: so that
these rays, which sensibly affect the quantity of light received
at each point P, may safely be regarded as being equal
in intensity.</p>

<p>When the centre of agitation has undergone a condensation,
the expansive force tends to urge the molecules in every
direction; and if they do not perform a retrograde motion,
it is only because their initial velocities forwards destroy
those which the expansion of the condensed fluid would
otherwise generate backwards: but it does not follow from
this that the agitation can only be propagated in the direction
of the initial velocities; for the expansive force in a
perpendicular direction, for example, will combine with the
primitive impulse without any diminution of its effects. It
is obvious that the intensity of the undulation thus produced
may vary much at the different points of its circumference,
not only from the nature of the initial impulse, but also because
the condensations are not subject to the same law on
every side of the centre of the agitated part[?]. But the
variations of the intensity of the derivative undulation must
necessarily be subjected to a law of continuity, and may consequently
be considered as insensible in a very small angular
interval, especially in the neighbourhood of the perpendicular
to the surface of the primitive undulation; for the initial
velocities of the molecules, referred to any given direction,
being proportional to the cosines of the angles made by that
direction with the perpendicular, these results vary much
<span class="xxpn" id="p437">[p437]</span>
more slowly than the angles themselves, while they remain
inconsiderable.</p>

<p>If, in fact, we consider rays sensibly inclined to each other,
such as <span class="allcaps">EP</span>, <span class="allcaps">FP</span>, <span class="allcaps">IP</span>, meeting in the point P, which we may
suppose at the distance of a great number of breadths from
the undulation <span class="allcaps">EA</span>: and if we take two arcs, <span class="allcaps">EF</span> and <span class="allcaps">FI</span>, of
such a length that the differences <span class="allcaps">EP−FP</span>
and <span class="allcaps">FP−IP</span> may
be equal to half an undulation: on account of the marked
obliquity of the rays, and of the smallness of a semiundulation,
in proportion to their length, these two arcs will be
almost equal, and the rays which come from them to the
point P will be nearly parallel; so that on account of the
difference of a semiundulation between the corresponding
rays of the two arcs, their effects will mutually destroy each
other.</p>

<p>We may therefore suppose all the rays sent by the different
parts of the undulation at <span class="allcaps">AE</span>, to the point P, to be of
equal intensity, since the only rays, with respect to which
this hypothesis would be incorrect, are such as have no sensible
influence on the quantity of light which it receives.
For the same reason, in order to simplify the calculation of
the result of all these elementary undulations, we may consider
their constituent motions as performed in the same direction,
the angles which they form with each other being
inconsiderable. The problem is thus reduced to that which
has been solved in the Memoir on Diffraction, already
quoted: <em class="italic">To find the result of any number of systems of
parallel undulations of light, of the same frequency, when
their intensities and relative situations are given</em>.—The
intensities are here proportional to the length of the small
illuminating arcs, and the relative situations are given from
the differences of the paths described.</p>

<p>We have considered, correctly speaking, only the section
of the undulation made by a plane perpendicular to the margin
of the screen represented by A. We may now take into
account the whole extent of the undulation, and suppose it
to be divided, by equidistant meridians perpendicular to the
plane of the figure, into infinitely thin wedges or strata;
and we may apply to all of these the reasoning which has
<span class="xxpn" id="p438">[p438]</span>
been employed for one section, and thus demonstrate that
the rays which have a marked obliquity must destroy each
other.</p>

<p>These strata, in the case here considered, being all parallel
to the edge of the screen, and infinitely extended, while the
undulation is intercepted but on one side; the intensity of
the result of all the impressions, which they transmit to P,
will be the same for each of them: for the rays emanating
from them must be considered as of equal intensity, at least
for the very small extent of the generating undulation, which
has a sensible influence on the light received at P. Besides,
each elementary result will evidently be retarded by the
same quantity, with respect to the ray derived from the
point of the stratum nearest to P, that is to say, to the
point in which it cuts the plane of the figure: consequently
the intervals between these elementary results will be equal
to the differences of the paths described by the rays <span class="allcaps">AP</span>,
<em class="italic">m′</em>P, <em class="italic">m</em>P, and so forth, which are in the plane of the
figure, and their intensities will be proportional to the arcs
A<em class="italic">m′</em>, <em class="italic">m′</em>, <em class="italic">m</em>, <em class="italic">m</em>M, and so forth. We may therefore consider
the intensity of the general result as determined by the
calculation already mentioned, as belonging to the section of
the undulation made by a plane perpendicular to the margin
of the screen.</p>

<p>While the outline of the screen remains rectilinear, it is
sufficient, in order to determine the situations of the dark
and light stripes, and their relative intensities, to consider
the section of the undulation made by a plane perpendicular
to that outline: but when it is curved, or composed of lines
meeting at any angles, it becomes necessary to obtain the
integral effect for two directions at right angles to each other,
or for a circle surrounding the point considered. This last
method is the most simple in some particular cases, as when
we have to calculate, for example, the intensity of the light
in the projection of the centre of a circular screen or opening:
[a simplification which, though sufficiently obvious, had perhaps
not occurred to Mr.
<span class="smcaps">F<span>RESNEL</span></span>, until it was pointed out
to him by the Translator of this paper.]</p>

<p>It will now be easy to form a distinct idea of the method
<span class="xxpn" id="p439">[p439]</span>
which must be followed, in order to calculate the situation
and the intensity of the dark and bright stripes, in the different
circumstances under which it is proposed to compare
the theory with experiment. When the screen is infinitely
extended on one side, or is broad enough to allow us to
neglect the rays which pass beyond it, we are to determine,
for any point P at the distance of the place at which the
fringes are to be observed, the result of all the elementary
undulations coming from the part <span class="allcaps">AMF</span> only of the incident
wave; and comparing the intensities at different collateral
points, P, P′, P″, we are to find the situation of the darkest
and the brightest points. In this manner we find, for a
screen closed on one side, 1st, that the intensity of the light
decreases rapidly within the [shadow] beginning from the
tangent <span class="allcaps">CAB</span>, and <em class="italic">so much the more rapidly as the undulation
is smaller</em>; and this in a continuous manner, without
any alternations of maxima and minima; 2ndly, that out of
the shadow, the intensity of the light, after augmenting considerably
to a certain point, which may be called a maximum
of the first order, decreases to another point, which is the
minimum of the first order: that it increases again to a
second maximum, to which succeeds a second minimum, and
so forth; 3rdly, that none of these minimums completely
vanish, as in the case of fringes produced by the concourse
of two luminous pencils of equal intensity, and that the difference
between the maxima and minima diminishes in proportion
as we go further from the shadow; whence we may
understand why the fringes which surround shadows in a
homogeneous light, are less marked and less numerous, than
those which are obtained by a combination of two mirrors,
and those in white light much less brilliant; 4thly, that
the intervals been the maxima and minima are unequal, and
diminish, as we depart from the shadow, in proportions
which remain unaltered, whatever may be the distance from
the screen at which we measure them; and 5thly, that the
same maxima and minima, calculated for different distances
from the screen, are situated in hyperbolas of a sensible curvature,
of which the foci are the edge of the screen, and the
luminous point. All these consequences of the theory are
precisely confirmed by experiment.
<span class="xxpn" id="p440">[p440]</span></p>

<p>The general formula gives the position of the maxima and
minima for any distances whatever of the luminous point from
the screen, and from the screen to the micrometer, when the
length of the undulation of the light employed is known.
In order to submit the theory to a decisive test, instead of
determining the length of the undulation by measures of the
external fringes, and then employing it in calculations of the
same kind, I deduced it from an experiment on diffraction of
a very different kind; and after having first verified it by
the fringes obtained from two mirrors, of which it represented
the breadth within a hundredth part of the truth, I
introduced it into the formula which I afterwards compared
with 125 measurements of exterior fringes, made under very
different circumstances; for the distance of the radiant point
from the screen was varied from four inches to six or seven
yards, and the distance between the screen and the micrometer
was varied from
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">13</span></span>th</span>
of an inch to more than four yards:
and the results of all these comparisons were perfectly satisfactory,
as maybe seen in the comparative table published
in the XIth volume of the Annales de Chimie et de Physique,
p. 339, 343.</p>

<p>When the screen, instead of extending infinitely on one
side, is narrow enough to admit some light on that side, not
too much weakened by the rapid decrease of intensity produced
by obliquity, we must take into the calculation the
light on both sides, and find, for each point of the shadow,
the general result of all the elementary undulations derived
from the points on the right and left. We thus demonstrate
that the interior parts of the shadow must be divided by a series
of dark and bright stripes, nearly equal in breadth, of which
the situations differ very little from those which would be
deduced from the approximative formula which has already
been given for the same purpose, when they are still separated
from the borders of the shadow by an interval of several of
their breadths. But when the opaque body is narrow enough,
and the micrometer far enough removed for the observed
stripes to be very near the exterior stripes, then the results
of this more exact calculation, as well as those of experiment,
show that the approximation is no longer accurate. The
<span class="xxpn" id="p441">[p441]</span>
calculation determines also, with remarkable precision, the singular
alterations which the exterior fringes often undergo,
when the other series extends beyond the shadow, and mixes
its effects with those of the exterior.</p>

<p>I have also verified the theory by examining the fringes
derived from a narrow slit of indefinite length; and determining,
for the different points enlightened by the luminous
pencil, the result of all the elementary undulations derived
from the part of the primitive wave comprehended in the
breadth of the slit; and I have found a satisfactory agreement
between the calculation and the observations, even
when the fringes thus obtained afforded the most capricious
and apparently irregular appearances.</p>

<p>In this mode of considering the problems relating to diffraction,
we have not taken into the calculation the greater or
less thickness of the edges of the screen, but merely the
extent of the primitive wave which is capable of sending
elementary undulations to the points for which we are to find
the intensity of illumination; and the opaque substance has
no other effect than simply to intercept a part of the wave:
for this reason the result is necessarily independent of the
nature of the body, of its mass, and of the thickness of its edges.
Nevertheless, if the surface of the edges were very extensive,
it would be impossible to consider the portion of the wave as
quitting the slit without having received some previous modification,
and it would be necessary to take into the calculation
the small fringes derived from the effect of the remoter
parts of the slit. But while the thickness is moderate, or
the edges rounded off into a well marked curve, the small
fringes derived from this cause may be neglected, and the
emerging wave may be considered as of equal intensity throughout,
at the moment of its quitting the screen, especially if the
intensity of the light is to be calculated for a pretty considerable
distance from the screen. We must not, indeed, forget,
that according to the reasoning which has been employed,
the formulas for diffraction are only sufficiently exact when
this distance is very considerable, in comparison with the
breadth of an undulation, since it is in this case only that
we can neglect the rays that are decidedly oblique, and
<span class="xxpn" id="p442">[p442]</span>
can suppose all those, which are essentially concerned in the
effect, to be nearly of equal intensity. It is not, however,
surprising that the same formulas will give the position of
the fringes with sufficient accuracy at small distances from
the screen, when its edges are thin, since, the mean breadth
of an undulation being but about one fifty thousandth of an
inch, a tenth of an inch becomes comparatively a very considerable
distance.</p>

<p>These are the three principal kinds of phenomena presented
to us by diffraction, when the edges of the screen, or of the
opening made in it, are sufficiently extensive to afford fringes
independent of any effect from their terminations: and in
such cases it is sufficient to make the integral calculation for
the plane perpendicular to the edges of the screen only, in
order to determine the position of the dark and bright
stripes, and their comparative intensities. But when the
screen or the opening are of small dimensions in every direction,
it becomes necessary to extend the integration to the
effects produced in two perpendicular planes: and the results
of the calculation agree perfectly with observation, as will
appear from two curious instances.</p>

<p>When the screen is circular, the calculation leads to this
singular result, that the centre of the shadow projected by
it must be as much enlightened as if the screen were not in
existence. It was Mr.
<span class="smcaps">P<span>OISSON</span></span> that first pointed out this
consequence of my formulas, which I did not at first observe,
though it is immediately deducible from the theory by very
simple geometrical considerations. Mr.
<span class="smcaps">A<span>RAGO</span></span> made the
experiment with the shadow of a screen
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">13</span></span>th</span>
of an inch in
diameter, perfectly round, and fixed on a plate of glass. The
result confirmed the fact which had been announced by the
theory. It is only the centre itself that possesses this property,
and the same brightness is only extended to a sensible
distance from this mathematical point when the screen is of
very small diameter, and when its shadow is observed at a
great distance: for the wider that the screen becomes, the
more the little bright circle is contracted; and when the
screen is four tenths of an inch in diameter, we only see a
single point of light, at the distance of a yard, even with a
powerful magnifier. It must be observed, that if the screen
<span class="xxpn" id="p443">[p443]</span>
were too large, the reasoning, from which the formulas have
been deduced, would no longer be rigorously applicable to
the rays inflected into the shadow, because of their too great
obliquity, which would render it impossible to consider their
effects as equal in intensity to those of the direct rays.</p>

<div class="bigfract">
<p>When we calculate, by the same formulas, the intensity of
the light in the centre of the projection of a small circular
aperture, made in a large screen, we find that this centre
will exhibit alternately a bright and a dark appearance, according
to the distance at which the shadow is viewed; and
that in homogeneous light this darkness must be perfect.
This new inference from the general formulas may be deduced
from the theory by very simple geometrical considerations.
Thus we find that the values of the successive distances, at
which the centre of the shadow becomes completly dark, are
<em class="italic">b</em>&#160;=
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fract"><span class="fup"><em class="italic">a</em><em class="italic">r</em><sup>2</sup></span><span class="fdn">2<em class="italic">a</em><em class="italic">d</em>−<em class="italic">r</em><sup>2</sup></span></span>,</span>

and so forth;

distances from the luminous point and from the micrometer,
and <em class="italic">d</em> the length of the undulation of the light employed.
Now, if we place the micrometer at the distances
indicated by these formulas, we observe, in fact, that the
centre of the projection of the opening is so completely deprived
of light, that it appears like a spot of ink in the middle
of the illuminated part, at least with respect to the minimums
of the first three orders, as indicated by the formulas here
inserted: those of the subsequent orders, which are nearer
to the screen, exhibiting no longer the same degree of darkness,
on account of the want of homogeneity of the light
employed.</p></div>

<p>There is still a multitude of other phenomena of diffraction,
such as those of multiplied and coloured images,
reflected by striated surfaces, as seen through a texture of
fine fibres, as well as the coloured rings, produced by an
irregular collection of such fibres, or of light powders,
consisting of particles nearly equal, placed between the
eye of the spectator and a luminous object; all of which
may be explained and rigorously computed by means of the
theory which has been laid down. It would, however, occupy
too much of our time to describe them here, and to
<span class="xxpn" id="p444">[p444]</span>
show how exactly they concur in confirming the theory;
which indeed appears to be abundantly demonstrated by the
numerous and diversified facts which have been already
adduced in support of it. It will be sufficient to conclude
this extract of the Memoir on Diffraction with a detailed description
of an important experiment of Mr.
<span class="smcaps">A<span>RAGO</span></span>, which
furnishes us with a method of determining the slightest differences
of the refractive powers of bodies, with a degree of
accuracy almost unlimited.</p>

<p>We have seen that the fringes, produced by two very narrow
slits, are always placed symmetrically with regard to
a plane passing through the luminous point and the middle
of the interval between the slits, as long as the two pencils
of light which interfere have passed through the same medium,
for instance, the air, as happens in the ordinary arrangement
of the apparatus. But the result is different when
one of the pencils continues to pass through the air, and the
other has to be transmitted by a more refractive body, a
thin plate of mica, for example, or a piece of glass blown
very thin: the fringes are then displaced, and carried towards
the side on which the transparent substance is placed:
and if its thickness becomes at all considerable, they are
removed out of the enlightened space, and disappear altogether.
This important experiment, which was first made by
Mr. Arago, may also be performed with the apparatus of the
two mirrors, if the plate be placed in the way of one of the
pencils, either before or after its reflection.</p>

<p>Let us now see what inference may be drawn from this
remarkable fact, by the assistance of the principle of interferences.
The light stripe in the middle is always derived,
as we have already seen, from the simultaneous arrival of
rays which have issued at the same moment from the luminous
point; consequently, in the common circumstances of
the experiment, they must have described paths exactly
equal, in order to arrive in the same time at the place of
meeting: but it is obvious that if they pass through mediums
in which light is not propagated with the same velocity,
that pencil, which has travelled the more slowly, will arrive
at the given point later than the other, and the point will
<span class="xxpn" id="p445">[p445]</span>
therefore no longer be in the bright stripe. The stripe must
therefore necessarily change its place towards the pencil which
travels the more slowly, in order that the shortness of its
path may compensate for the delay during its transmission
through the solid: and the converse of the proposition
enables us to conclude, that where the stripes are displaced,
the pencil towards which they move has been retarded in its
passage. The natural inference, therefore, “from Mr.
<span class="smcaps">A<span>RAGO</span></span>’s
experiment,” is, that light is propagated more rapidly in
the air than in mica or glass, and generally in all bodies more
refractive than the air; a result directly opposite to the
Newtonian theory of refraction, which, supposes the particles
of light to be strongly attracted by dense substances, which
would cause the velocity of light to be greater in these bodies
than in rarer mediums.</p>

<p>This experiment furnishes a method of comparing the
velocity of the propagation of light in different mediums, [or,
in other words, the refractive density, which is always supposed
in this theory, to be reciprocally proportional to it.]
If, in fact, we measure very accurately, by means of a spherometer,
the thickness of the thin plate of glass which has
been placed in the way of one of the luminous pencils, and
if the displacement of the fringes has been measured by the
micrometer; since we know that, before the interposition of
the glass, the paths described were equal for the middle of
the central stripe, we may calculate how much difference is
occasioned by the change of position, and this difference
will give the retardation in the plate of glass, of which the
thickness is known: so that, by adding this thickness to the
difference calculated, we shall find the little path which the
other pencil has described in the air, while the former was
transmitted by the plate of glass; and this path, compared
with the thickness of the plate of glass, will give the proportion
of the velocity of the light in the air, to its velocity
within the glass.</p>

<p>We may also consider this problem in another point of
view, with which it is convenient to make ourselves familiar.
The duration of each undulation, as we have seen, does not
depend on the greater or less velocity with which the
<span class="xxpn" id="p446">[p446]</span>
agitation is propagated along the fluid, but merely on the duration
of the previous oscillation which gave it birth; consequently,
when the luminous waves pass from one medium into another,
in which they are propagated more slowly, each undulation
is performed in the same interval of time as before, and the
greater density of the medium has no other effect than that
of diminishing the length of the undulation, in the same
proportion as the velocity of light is diminished: for the
length of the undulation is equal to the space that the first
agitation describes during the time of a complete oscillation.
We may therefore calculate the relative velocities of light in
different mediums, by comparing the length of the undulations
of the same kind of light in those mediums. Now, the
middle of the central stripe is formed by the reunion of such
rays of the two pencils as have performed the same number
of undulations, in their way from the luminous point, whatever
may be the nature of the mediums transmitting the
light. If then the central stripe is brought towards the
side of the pencil which has passed through the glass, it is
because the undulations of light are shorter within the glass
than in the air; and it is necessary, in consequence, that the
path described on this side should be shorter than the other,
in order that the number of undulations may remain the
same. Let us suppose, then, that the central stripe has been
displaced to the extent of twenty breadths of fringes, for
example, or of twenty times the interval between the middle
points of two consecutive dark stripes; we must necessarily
conclude that the interposition of the plate of glass has retarded
the progress of the pencil passing through it to the
extent of twenty undulations; or that it has performed within
the plate twenty undulations more than the same pencil would
have performed in an equal thickness of air, since each breadth
of a fringe answers to the difference of a single undulation.
If then we know the thickness of the plate, and the length
of an undulation of the light employed, which is easily deduced
from the measurement of the fringes, by the formula
that has been given, we can calculate the number of undulations
comprehended in the same thickness of air, and by
adding twenty to the number, we shall have that of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p447">[p447]</span>
undulations performed in the thickness of the glass; and the
proportion of these two numbers will be that of the velocities
of light in the different mediums. Now this proportion
is found by experiment the same with that of the sines of
incidence and of refraction between air and glass; which
agrees with the theory of the refraction of undulations, as
will be seen hereafter.</p>

<p>The same experiment may be employed, on the other hand,
for determining with extreme precision the thickness of a
thin plate of a substance of known refractive density; placing
it in the way of one of the two pencils of light, and measuring
the displacement of the fringes which it occasions.</p>

<p>This method of determining refractive densities is however
liable to some difficulties, when we wish to apply it to
a body much more dense than air, such as water, or glass, for
example; since it is necessary to employ a very thin plate
only, in order that the fringes may not be too much displaced
for observation; and then it becomes difficult to
measure the thickness of such a plate with sufficient accuracy.
We may, indeed, place in the way of the other pencil
a thick plate of a transparent substance, of which the refractive
density has been ascertained by the ordinary methods,
and we can then employ as thick a plate of the new substance.
But then it becomes simpler to measure its refractive
density by the common method: [unless we choose to
immerse the whole apparatus in a fluid very nearly approaching
to it in refractive density, which may sometimes be done
without inconvenience.
<span class="smcaps">T<span>R.</span></span>]</p>

<p>The case, in which Mr. Arago’s experiment has a decided
advantage over the direct method, is when we desire to
determine very slight differences of velocity in mediums of
nearly equal refractive density: for by lengthening the passage
of the light in the two mediums of which we wish to
compare the refractive density, we can increase the accuracy
of the results almost without limit. In order to form an idea
of the extreme precision that may be attained by these measurements,
it is sufficient to observe that the length of the
yellow undulations in air being about .000021 E.I., there are
two millions of them in the length of about 42 inches. Now
<span class="xxpn" id="p448">[p448]</span>
it is very easy to observe the difference of one fifth of a
fringe, which corresponds to a retardation of one fifth of an
undulation in one of the pencils, that is, the ten millionth
part of the whole length of 42 inches; we might therefore,
by introducing any gas or vapour into a tube of this length,
terminated by two plane glasses, estimate very accurately the
variation of its refractive power.</p>

<p>I take the length of an undulation of the yellow rays,
which are the most brilliant of the spectrum, and of which
the dark and light stripes consequently coincide with the
darkest and brightest stripes of the fringes produced by
white light, which is commonly employed in these experiments,
both because of its greater brightness, and because of
the more marked character which it gives to the central stripe,
so as to prevent any other from being mistaken for it.</p>

<p>It was an apparatus of this kind that Mr.
<span class="smcaps">A<span>RAGO</span></span> and
myself employed for measuring the difference of the refractive
powers of dry air, and of air saturated with moisture at
80° F., which is so small, that it would escape every other
method of observation, because the greater refractive power
of aqueous vapour is almost exactly compensated by the less
specific gravity of moist air. But, in the generality of cases,
the slightest mixture of one vapour or gas with another
produces a considerable displacement in the fringes: and if
we had a series of experiments of this kind, made with care,
the apparatus might become a valuable instrument of chemical
analysis.</p>

<p class="first">My dear Sir,</p>

<p>I
<span class="smmaj">AM</span>
very glad to see that you have been applying your
analytical powers to the investigation of the acustical effects
of corpuscular forces, and that, among many more refined determinations,
you, have confirmed several of the results relating
to sounding bodies, which were published twenty years
ago in my Lectures on Natural Philosophy: though they
were generally such as might have been derived from the calculations
of Bernoulli and Euler; which I attempted in some
<span class="xxpn" id="p449">[p449]</span>
measure to simplify by the introduction of the element which
I called the <em class="italic">Modulus of Elasticity</em> of each substance. You
have very properly observed that it is often difficult to represent
the combination of these corpuscular forces by an
integral, since in many practical cases the integral must
vanish, where it would naturally be applied to the phenomena:
and, from similar considerations, I trust you will be
prepared to admit the objections that I made long ago, to
the reasoning of your great predecessor, Mr. Laplace, to
whose station in the mathematical world you appear so eminently
qualified to succeed.</p>

<p>The equation, which may be called final, in Mr. Laplace’s
Supplement to the Xth Book, p. 47, is
<span class="nowrap"><em class="italic">Q</em>&#8201;cos.&#8201;(ω−θ)&#160;=</span>
<span class="nowrap">(2ς−ς′)&#8201;<em class="italic">K</em>&#8201;sin.&#8201;θ.</span>
Now this, in my opinion, is a perfect
<em class="italic">reductio ad absurdum</em>: for <em class="italic">Q</em> must <em class="italic">always</em> be <em class="italic">incomparably</em>
less than <em class="italic">K</em>; the attraction of the particles lying between a
cylinder and its tangent plane being <em class="italic">always</em> infinitely less
than that of the particles in an angular or prismatic edge:
or if this were denied in general, it would obviously become
true when the cylinder itself becomes a plane, and <em class="italic">Q</em> vanishes
altogether; which will always be the state of the
problem, when the surface of the solid is so inclined to the
horizon, that the surface of the fluid may remain horizontal,
the appropriate angle of contact being unaltered in these
circumstances, as it is easy to show by making the experiment
with mercury.</p>

<p>I entreat you to consider this objection with patient attention,
and to tell me if you can find any arguments to supersede
it. I would also presume to ask your opinion of my own
method of deducing the force of capillarity from the elementary
attractions and repulsions of bodies, at the end of my
Illustrations of the Celestial Mechanics, Art. 382; Appendix
A, p. 329 to 337. The volume is in the Library of the Academy;

with which you have had the kindness to favour me.</p>

<p>The fifth column shows the apparent difference of declination
between the Star and Moon’s centre at the immersion and emersion;
the letters N and S denoting the Star to be north or south from the
Moon. The sixth or last column shows the point of the Moon’s limb
where the immersion and emersion take place, reckoning from the
vertex or highest point; the letters L and R signifying to the left
hand or right hand of the observer.</p>

<p>An error of 11 seconds in the computed difference of declination
between the Moon and Star, will be sufficient to convert the
expected Occultation of α<sup>2</sup> Libræ, on 29th April, into an Appulse;
and a less error will considerably affect the times and places of
immersion and emersion.</p></div><!--pp450-1-box-->

We may, from the above experiments, observe the approximation to
perfection in the art of screw making; for had the screw been
greater in diameter, there would have been a waste of material, or
had it been less, it would not have been sufficiently strong, which
may be proved as follows: the cohesion of wrought iron has been
found, from a number of experiments, to be about 43000 lbs. per
cylindrical inch; and as the smallest diameter of screw used in my
experiment was 0.15, it would have been torn asunder by a force
of about 968 lbs.; or if the hard wood had been about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">5</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>
of an inch
thick into which it had been screwed, the screw would have been
broken instead of forcing its passage out of the wood.—<em class="italic">Phil. Mag.

consumed, except indeed upon short occasions. In one of the cases
in question, an engine at Wheal Hope, of sixty-inch cylinder, working

<div class="h5d"><h5>3. <em class="italic">Improved
Clock</em>.</h5>—Among the articles displayed at the first
National Exhibition of the Objects of Arts and Industry, at Neufchatel,
Switzerland, last year, was a clock made by F. Houriet, of
Locle; in which steel was used only in the main springs and in the
axes of the moveable parts; all the other parts were in brass, gold
alloy, and white gold. The number of pieces in gold, gold and
silver, gold and platina, is sixty-two: all the pivots turn on jewels,
and the functions of the free escapements are effected also by means
of pallets in precious stones. It had been supposed that the escapements
and the spiral spring not being of steel, inconvenience
would result from the smaller degree of elasticity, but numerous
trials with favourable results have removed the objection; and it
appears that gold, hardened either by hammering or other means,
is more elastic than hardened and untempered steel. The clock
had gone for six days, exposed to the contact of a magnet competent
to lift twenty-five or thirty pounds, without suffering any
derangement.—<em class="italic">Rév. Ency.</em></div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>4. <em class="italic">Method of
dividing Glass by Friction</em>.</h5>—The following method
is described by Dr. Hare: “Some years ago Mr. Lukin showed
me that a small phial or tube might be separated into two parts, if
subjected to cold water after being heated by the friction of a cord
made to circulate about it, by two persons alternately pulling in opposite
directions. I was subsequently enabled to employ this process
in dividing large vessels of four or five inches in diameter, and
likewise to render it in every case more easy and certain by means
of a piece of plank forked like a boot-jack, and also having a kerf
cut by a saw, parallel to and nearly equidistant from the principal
surfaces of the plank, and at right angles to the incisions productive
of the fork.</div>

<p>“By means of the fork, the glass is easily held steadily by the
hand of one operator; by means of the kerf, the string, while
<span class="xxpn" id="p455">[p455]</span>
circulating about the glass, is confined to the part where the separation
is desired. As soon as the cord smokes, the glass is plunged
in water, or if too large to be easily immersed, the water must be
thrown upon it; the latter method is always preferable when,
upon immersing the body, the water can reach the inner surface.
As plunging is the most effectual method of employing the water
in the case of a tube, I usually close the end which is to be
immersed.”—<em class="italic">Silliman’s Journal</em>, xiii. 7.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>5. <em class="italic">Use of Soapstone in diminishing
Friction</em>.</h5>—In a letter to
Professor Silliman upon this subject, Mr. E. Bailey of Boston,
says, “I understand the Soapstone has been used for this purpose
in the extensive manufactories at Lowell, for about two years, and
with great profit and success. Besides answering the purpose to
which it is applied very much better than any other substance that
can be procured, it saves a great deal of trouble and expense. It
is first thoroughly pulverized, and then mixed with oil, tallow, lard,
or tar, whichever may be the best adapted to the use for which it is
designed. It is of course important to procure that which is free
from <em class="italic">grit</em>, and it can be purified in a good degree by mixing the
powder with oil, and decanting it after it has stood a few minutes.
The heavier particles will form a sediment to be rejected. It is
used in all kinds of machinery where it is necessary to apply any
unctuous substance to diminish friction, and it is said to be an
excellent substitute for the usual composition applied to
carriage-wheels.”</div>

<p>Some idea of the value of soapstone thus applied, may be formed
from the following fact communicated by D. Moody, Esq., the
superintendent of the tar-works on the mill-dam near this city.
Connected with the rolling machine of that establishment, there is
a horizontal balance-wheel, weighing <em class="italic">fourteen tons</em>, which runs on
a step of five inches diameter, and makes from seventy-five to one
hundred revolutions in a minute. About one hundred tons of iron
are rolled in this machine in a month; yet the wheel has sometimes
been used from three to five weeks without inconvenience,
before the soapstone has been renewed. The superintendent thinks,
however, that it ought to be more frequently employed.</p>

<p>“The use of soapstone was discovered at Lowell. It has been
said never to fail in producing the desired result when applied
to machinery which had began to be heated, even in those cases
when nothing else could be found that would answer the
purpose.”—<em class="italic">Silliman’s Journal</em>, xiii. 192.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>6. <em class="italic">On peculiar Physical Repulsions,
by</em> M. Saigey.</h5>—I intend to
give in this bulletin the description of a very simple apparatus, by
means of which I have made many experiments, which have conducted
me to the following results:—</div>

<p>i. All bodies exert between themselves a feeble repulsive action
in ordinary circumstances. The repulsion between bismuth and
<span class="xxpn" id="p456">[p456]</span>
antimony and the poles of a magnetic needle, is a case of this general
law, and is not due to magnetism. Nor is it magnetism which
occasions the direction of needles formed of other substances than

<div class="h5d"><h5>9. <em class="italic">On the Measurement of the
Intensity of Light, by</em> M. Peclet.</h5>—A
very usual photometrical process is to interpose an opaque body
between a white screen and the two lights to be measured, and
to move the latter until the shadows produced are of equal intensity;
the intensity of the lights being then as the square of their
distances from the shadows they illuminate. Sometimes a translucent
body, as unpolished glass or oiled paper, is used in place
of an opaque one, the shades produced by transmission being
observed.</div>

<p>In both these methods, the apparent intensity of the shadow
varies with the position of the observer. If the shadows are equal
when observed from a point perpendicular to the white screen at
the middle of the distance of the two shades, they will be no longer
so on removing from that position, and the shadow nearest to the
observer will always appear the darkest. These apparent variations
are greater as the shadows are farther apart, or with reflected shadows
as the screen is smoother, or with transmitted shadows as the
interposed obstacle is more diaphanous.</p>

<p>The explanation given of this fact is, that unpolished opaque
bodies, like paper, plaster, &#38;c. never disperse the light incident
upon them, in an uniform manner, more rays passing in the direction
in which regular reflexion would take place, than in any other.
Hence, when two equal shadows are produced upon such a surface,
either by two equal lights at equal distances, or by two unequal
lights at unequal distances; the shadow nearest to the observer
must necessarily appear deeper than the other, because it is enlightened
by the nearest light, the rays from which are reflected in
greatest abundance away from the observer; and, on the contrary,
the shadow further from the observer should appear lightest, because
the rays which fall on it from the furthest light are reflected
in greatest abundance towards the side on which the observer
stands. The reason, also, why the effect is greater as the shadows
are further apart is evident; and why in every case it is reduced to
nothing when the observer is in a plane perpendicular to the screen
and equidistant from the two shadows.</p>

<p>From these facts and explanations it may be concluded, that, in
all photometrical measurements by reflected shadows, the screens
should have all smoothness removed from them, and the two
<span class="xxpn" id="p458">[p458]</span>
shadows brought as near together as possible, and even made to
touch or over-lap; or that, when this cannot be done, the observation
should be made from a point equidistant from the two shadows.
As to the shadows by transmission, the apparent variations
of intensity are so great for small changes in the position of the
eye, as to render the method altogether inapplicable.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em>

generally less in a vacuum than in the air, so that a syphon barometer
gives results too high, and the more so as the tube is smaller.

<div class="h5d"><h5>14. <em class="italic">Sapphire Lenses for Single Microscopes</em>.</h5>—As it may justly
be feared that, notwithstanding the incontestable superiority of
diamond lenses, the cost and difficulty attendant on their production
will enhance their value beyond the reach of the public, Mr.
A. Pritchard, No. 18, Pickett Street, has applied himself with
indefatigable perseverance to the formation of <em class="italic">Sapphire Lenses</em>.
The valuable experiments of Dr. Brewster have determined that
the sapphire possesses a stronger refraction than any other substance
capable of giving a single image (diamond excepted),
<span class="xxpn" id="p460">[p460]</span>
while its dispersive power is only 0.026 compared to water as
0.035. Thus if a sapphire is ground in the same tool which will
form a lens of glass of the
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">60</span></span>
inch focus, it will come out about
the <span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">100</span></span>
inch focus; being almost double the power of the glass in
linear amplification, and more than double in superficial; in which
latter mode of estimation the powers of the glass and sapphire may
be rated at 360,000 to 1,000,000. The faint blue tinge of the sapphire
is not felt in thin small lenses formed of this substance, which
thus come next in order to diamond ones, and form an excellent
<em class="italic">pis aller</em> for those who cannot come at the latter. Many of our
first microscopists are already in possession of them, and have
honoured them with their unqualified approbation.</div>

<p>There is a property possessed by small single lenses formed by
precious stones, which is worthy of being commented on: viz. They
can be burnished fast into brass rings, and thus safely cleaned and
removed at pleasure from one setting to another. The cohesion of
glass is too slight to permit this operation, during which it is
almost sure to burst into shivers.—C. R. G.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>15. <em class="italic">On a Method of Securing and Preserving the Rowing Pins
in Boats</em>.</h5>—Dear Sir,—To remove a petty inconvenience of hourly
occurrence, by some simple contrivance, is often productive of a
greater mass of advantage than an invention of greater splendour,
and of apparently more extensive utility.</div>

<div class="figc-s1">
<img src="images/i460.jpg" width="600" height="322" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the accompanying drawing, you have a plan for preserving
that indispensable requisite in a boat, the towels, or rowing pins;
the loss of which is not only very teasing, but often productive of
serious inconveniences; while the practice of stealing them from
each other forms a constant source of petty depredations, leading
to perpetual quarrels among seamen in harbours. He who has
been detained the better part of a day in the island of Sky, till half
<span class="xxpn" id="p461">[p461]</span>
a dozen of these pins could be procured, well knows how to value
that trifle, the neglect of which has caused the loss of his voyage,
and might have led to that of his boat and his life also.</p>

<p>Fixed towels cannot well be used when boats are to be hoisted
in alongside, as they are subject to be broken; and they are often
inconvenient in getting in water casks, as well as in many other
cases. Hence, pins capable of being unshipped are preferable.
These are frequently lost, and the want is not always discovered till
it cannot be replaced; or else it is not replaced without loss of that
time which is often so valuable at sea. Very often, also, the delay
of even a minute is rendered inconvenient or even dangerous;
when the boat is dragging alongside by the painter in a heavy sea,
and the vessel is either drifting or standing on.</p>

<p>The drawing requires little explanation. By pulling at the
lower pin, the two upper are fixed at once, and on being unshipped
they hang secure from loss; while the lower one serves us a spare
towel, should any be broken. As not one boat in twenty thousand
is provided with this invention, which is indeed scarcely known, it
will not perhaps be found undeserving a place in your

the instant the injection was wanted, when it was well worked up

discovered that a generator at a certain temperature,
although it had a small crack in it, would not emit either water or
steam. This fact I mentioned to a very scientific friend, who questioned
its accuracy, and to convince him I tried the experiment;
but he concluded that the expansion of the metal must have closed
the fissure. To remove every doubt, I proposed to drill a small
<span class="xxpn" id="p462">[p462]</span>
hole through the side of the generator, which was accordingly done.
After getting the steam up to a proper temperature, I took out the
plug, and although we were working the engine at thirty atmospheres,
nothing was seen or heard to issue from the plug-hole; all
was perfectly quiet: I next lowered the temperature by shutting
the damper, and opening the furnace door; a singing from the
aperture was soon observable, and when a coal was held before it,
rapid combustion ensued; nothing, however, was yet visible: but as
the temperature decreased, the steam became more and more visible,
the noise at the same increasing, until finally the roar was tremendous,
and might have been heard the distance of half a mile.
This was conclusive. I should mention that, at the aperture, the
iron was red-hot.” “The hole was one <em class="italic">quarter of an inch</em> in diameter.”</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>2. <em class="italic">On the Use of feeble Electric Currents, for effecting the Combination
of numerous Bodies, by</em> M. Becquerel.</h5>—A highly interesting
memoir on this subject is inserted in the thirty-fifth volume of the
<em class="italic">Annales de Chimie</em>, the intention of M. Becquerel being to show
that electro-chemical powers may be used not only for the decomposition
and analysis of bodies, but also for the production of new
compounds.</div>

<p>The facts described in the paper are commenced by one intended
to illustrate future reasoning, by shewing what takes place
when a very feeble electric current traverses a metallic circuit, interrupted
in one part by a neutral solution, into which the two extremities
of the wires forming the circuit are immersed. Two
small copper wires were connected together by loops, and the two
free ends joined to the ends of a galvanometer wire; the circuit
was then cut in one place, and the extremities immersed in a solution
of chloride of sodium. Then, if one of the loops be raised to a
red heat by a spirit lamp, an electric current is produced, the heated
loop furnishing negative electricity. Now if the ends plunged
in the saline solution are terminated by platina or gold wires,
<em class="italic">no current</em> of electricity is observed; with silver terminations,
the current is very feeble; but with wires of zinc, lead, iron or tin,
the current is very energetic. These remarkable effects, highly
important in the phenomena hereafter to be considered, are no way
connected with the conductibility of the metals; for lead and zinc,
which are the worst conductors, are those which, with the copper,
produce the most powerful effects. The current ceases altogether
as soon as the lamp is removed.</p>

<p>As the zinc, copper, lead, and iron, belong to the class of oxidable
metals, M. Becquerel concludes, from this experiment, that
<span class="xxpn" id="p463">[p463]</span>
when very feeble electricities are generated in any point of a metallic
circuit, interrupted by a saline solution, <em class="italic">a current of electricity is
formed or not, according as the two similar metallic terminations,
which dip into the solution, belong to an oxidable or non-oxidable
metal</em>. If the saline solution be replaced by an acid, <em class="italic">then</em> a current
will be obtained, though platina wires be used; because that kind of
fluid does not interrupt the current.</p>

<p>With respect to the production of new compounds by electro-chemical
powers, very much depends upon the strength of the
power employed, and M. Becquerel only pretends, as yet, to indicate
a new field of research, and not to point out the precise paths to be
pursued. Two methods may be adopted. As an illustration, let a
tube, from 4 to 8 hundredths of an inch in diameter, be bent into the
form of the letter U, and place a plug of amianthus at the bend, to
prevent the mixture of the fluids in the limbs: into one leg put a
mixture of deutoxide of copper and solution of the sulphate of
copper, the former will fall to the bottom; into the other put a saturated
solution of common salt, and also an excess of the dry substance,
then communicate the two fluids by a plate of copper. Very
shortly the end plunged in the sulphate will be covered with metallic
copper, and the acid set free will act upon the oxide of copper
below and form more sulphate, so that a set of decompositions and
recompositions will occur, and ultimately comparatively large crystals
of copper will be obtained.</p>

<p>In the other branch of the tube, a portion of the salt will be decomposed,
the muriatic acid will act upon the copper, which is
oxidised in consequence of its positive state, and will probably
produce an oxychloride, which will combine with the chloride
of sodium, and then octoedral crystals will be formed on the plate
of copper. The effects are produced either with or without access
to air.</p>

<p>When the crystals are well dried and inclosed in a tube hermetically
sealed, they suffer no change; but they are decomposed by
water into chloride of sodium and submuriate of copper.</p>

<p>If the voltaic experiment be continued for one or two months, the
crystals, from being colourless and limpid, become violet, and ultimately
acquire an emerald green hue, still remaining transparent. If
the chloride of sodium side be tested, it will be found that soda is
evolved during the experiment. A piece of copper simply immersed
in a solution of common salt, produces nothing more than a submuriate
of copper, which precipitates.</p>

<p><em class="italic">With silver</em>.—If a similar tube to that described have both
limbs filled with a solution of salt, a platina wire introduced into
one limb, a silver wire into the other, the extremities of the wire
connected so as to form a voltaic circuit, and the whole left for
some months, in about fifteen days crystals will be observed on
the silver wire; these will gradually increase and assume a rhomboidal
form. They have not yet been particularly examined, but
<span class="xxpn" id="p464">[p464]</span>
are known to be unchanged by water: during a long experiment
they change colour, becoming, first, violet, then blue.</p>

<p>Experiments similar to that with the copper, when repeated with
the same solutions, &#38;c., but the substitution of plates of lead and tin
for the copper plates, produced crystalline double chlorides of these
metals and sodium.</p>

<p>Muriate of ammonia being substituted for common salt in these
experiments, another series of double compounds was obtained with
copper, silver, lead, and zinc.</p>

<p>A double chloride of barium and lead was formed slowly in a
similar way.</p>

<p>When a solution of the iodide of potassium or sodium was used
instead of the solution of salt, then double iodides were obtained:
thus with lead rather a rapid formation of silky crystals occurred
upon the lead, which, when examined by water, were decomposed,
producing iodide of lead and solution of iodide of potash or soda.
A tube two or three times the diameter of the former may be used
for the experiment.</p>

<p>The second method of producing new combinations by weak
electro-chemical powers, depends upon the electro-motive action,
which is caused whenever a metal touches the oxides, or an oxide
of another metal. If an oxide of a metal, a plate of metal, and a
liquid be put into a tube closed at one extremity, there will be an
electro-motive action of the metal with the oxide, and of the liquid
with both these bodies; and the chemical effect will be according to
the resultant of these three forces, which can only be ascertained
by experiments.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the effects thus produced, three tubes, from
eight to twelve hundredths of an inch in diameter, were prepared, a
little protoxide of lead being put into one, deutoxide into the second,
and peroxide into the third; solution of muriate of ammonia
and a plate of lead were then added to each tube. After a time,
lead was precipitated in the first tube, very slight chemical changes
took place in the second, but a large quantity of double chloride of
lead and ammonia crystallized upon the lead in the third, in the
form of needles. Thus very different effects were produced, according
to the state of oxidation.</p>

<p>Solution of salt gave similar results with the oxides of lead and
lead.</p>

<p>The oxides of copper, with solutions of alkaline muriates, gave
curious results. With muriate of ammonia, crystals were produced
of considerable size, and different to those obtained by the former
process. In this experiment, the black and anhydrous deutoxide of
copper gradually acquired a blue colour, as if a hydrate were
formed under the influence of the feeble electric current formed
by the arrangement.</p>

<p>Copper, its deutoxide, and solution of corrosive sublimate, produced
a double chloride, crystallizing in plates, and possessing a
metallic lustre.

<div class="h5d"><h5>4. <em class="italic">On Bromine, by</em> M. A. de la Rive.</h5>—M. de la Rive has remarked
a curious fact respecting the conducting power of fluids for electricity
in the habitudes of bromine and water. He found, in the
first place, as M. Balard had stated, that pure dry bromine did not
conduct the electricity of a voltaic battery, consisting of sixty pairs
of plates very strongly charged, a delicate galvanometer being the
test: a similar experiment was then made with pure water, the
water being contained in a glass capsule, and communicated with
the battery and galvanometer by platina wires<a id="fnanchor_129_93" href="#fn_129_93" class="fnanchor">129</a>, and the deviation of
the needle was scarcely sensible. Some other experiments induced
M. de la Rive to believe, that water perfectly distilled and put into
vessels made of substances absolutely unacted upon, would not
conduct any portion of electricity: the purer the water, and the
more unchangeable the substance of the vessel, the feebler does the
conducting power become, until at last it is insensible.</div>

<p>A few drops of bromine were then added to the water, which soon
acquired a yellow colour, by dissolving a small portion of the substance;
being now included in the voltaic circuit, the galvanometer
needle was deviated 70°, and an abundant disengagement of gas
took place from the platina wires. These were oxygen and hydrogen,
in the usual proportion, proving that the water only had been
decomposed.</p>

<p>From these experiments it results, that a body which does not at
all conduct voltaic electricity, or at least but very badly, namely,
<em class="italic">pure water</em>, may be rendered a very good conductor, by its mixture
with a few drops of perfectly <em class="italic">non-conducting</em> substance, namely, <em class="italic">bromine</em>.
M. de la Rive has found the same fact to occur with iodine,
and iodine and water; and his father had observed, in a course of
experiments made a long time ago on the conducting power of
fluids, that diluted sulphuric acid is a better conductor than very
much concentrated acid: may not anhydrous sulphuric acid then be
a non-conductor like bromine, &#38;c.?—<em class="italic">Annales de Chimie</em>, xxxv. 161.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p><a class="fnlabel" id="fn_129_93" href="#fnanchor_129_93">129</a>
See, on this point, the statement by M. Becquerel,
p. 462, relative to the use of platina wires, when forming a
communicating medium with fluids.</p></div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>5. <em class="italic">Elementary
Nature of Bromine</em>.</h5>—Iodine colours a solution of
starch blue, bromine renders a similar solution orange colour. M.
A. de la Rive added a few drops of bromine to a solution of starch
<span class="xxpn" id="p466">[p466]</span>
coloured blue by iodine, and obtained a compound which gave two
distinct colours with starch, one brown, the other yellow; the difference
of colour corresponding with the two bromides of iodine described
by M. Balard. These compounds of iodine and bromine,
dissolved in a solution of starch, were subjected to the voltaic pile:
immediately the yellow solution became blue about the negative
pile, and orange about the positive pile, indicating the separation
and places of the iodine and bromine. Thus the smallest quantity of
iodine may be discovered in bromine; but when the experiment was
resorted to, to prove whether the idea thrown out, that bromine
was a compound of chlorine and iodine, was founded in fact or not,
it gave no such indication, and a solution of bromine in starch electrified
for a long time together, gave no appearance of iodine.
Hence M. de la Rive concludes, that bromine contains no iodine,
but is an element analogous to iodine and chlorine.</div>

<p>When bromine and iodine are combined, the former passes to
the positive pole, and is consequently more negative than the latter;
which accords with the observation of M. Balard, that it should
occupy a place between chlorine and iodine.</p>

<p>According to the <em class="italic">Bulletin Universelle</em>, when the letter to M. Arago,
containing an account of the facts above referred to, was read to
the Academy of Sciences, that body decided that the assertion of
M. Dumas that bromine was a compound of chlorine and iodine
should be considered as retracted, and that it should be so entered,
upon the procès-verbal of the sitting.—A. viii. 209.</p>

sea-water, taken up at Trieste, treated by chlorine, ether, &#38;c., according
to M. Balard’s process, produced five grains of bromide of
sodium, or 3.278 grains of bromine. It would appear that, in the
sea-water of Trieste, the bromine is unaccompanied by any iodine,
and the same is the case, according to M. Hermbstadt, with the
waters of the Dead Sea. In the water of the Mediterranean, on
the contrary, iodine always appears with the bromine.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>7. <em class="italic">Sale of Bromine</em>.</h5>—The discoverer of bromine, M. Balard, has
been enabled, by his improvements, to prepare that peculiar body
in quantities sufficient to permit its sale. It may be obtained at his
shop, Rue Argenterie à Montpellier, or at M. Quesneville’s manufactory
of chemical substances at Paris. The price is four francs
the gros (about 60 grains), fourteen francs the half ounce, and
twenty-three francs the ounce.</div>

<p>The salt remaining in the retort weighed 92.87 parts; nearly this
weight of water being added and heated, the whole was dissolved,
and on cooling, a salt, consisting of extremely minute filaments
resembling asbestos, was obtained, which, by capillary attraction,
retained a part of the residual solution so powerfully, that it was
necessary to absorb it by filtering paper.</p>

<p>Although it appeared improbable that the crystals could be a
variety of the known form of bisulphate of potash, yet supposing it
might be that salt with either less, or more than two atoms of water,
Mr. Phillips proceeded to its analysis. Some of the salt was readily
dried by exposure to the air of a warm room: 100 grains, by muriate
of baryta gave 154.75 grains of sulphate of baryta, equivalent
to 52.45 sulphuric acid: 109 grains heated to redness, lost 21.6 sulphuric
acid and water, and left 78.4 grains of neutral sulphate of
potash. The latter contain 35.6 grains of sulphuric acid, which,
subtracted from the whole quantity of 52.45, indicates 16.85 as
the quantity dissipated by heat; and this again, subtracted from the
21.6, indicates 4.75 water in the crystals. The quantity of acid
separated by heat is, therefore, very nearly half that remaining in the
neutral sulphate, and the salt in question appears to be a sesquisulphate
of potash, consisting of</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>10. <em class="italic">On certain Properties of Sulphur</em>.</h5>—The effect of heat upon
sulphur in first fusing it, but afterwards causing diminution of fluidity
in a certain degree proportionate to the temperature, has been long
and generally known, as well also as the peculiar soft state into
which the sulphur may be brought, by pouring it, when hot and
thickened, into cold water. M. Dumas has been led to examine
these phenomena for the purpose of acquiring a precise and particular
knowledge of the effects and changes.</div>

<p>Fused sulphur began to crystallize between 226° and 228°. Its
fusing point may be considered as 226°.4. Between 230° and 284°
it is as liquid as a clear varnish, and of the colour of amber;
at about 320° it begins to thicken, and acquire a red colour; on
increasing the heat, it becomes so thick, that it will not pour. This
effect is most marked between 428° and 572°; the colour being
then a red-brown. From 572° to the boiling point it becomes
thinner, but never so fluid as at 248°. The deep red-brown colour
continues until it boils.</p>

<p>When the most fluid sulphur is suddenly cooled, it becomes
brittle, but the thickened sulphur, similarly treated, remains soft,
and more soft as the temperature has been higher. Thus, at 230°,
the sulphur was very liquid, and yellow; and cooled suddenly by
immersion in water, it became yellow and very friable; at 374° it
was thick, and of an orange colour, but by cooling, became at first
soft and transparent, but soon friable, and of the ordinary appearance;
at 428°, it was red and viscid, and when cooled, soft,
transparent, and of an amber colour; at the boiling point it was
deep brown red colour, and when cooled very soft, transparent,
and of a red-brown colour.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, as is sometimes stated, to heat the sulphur
a long time to produce this effect; all depends upon temperature.
The only precaution necessary is, to have abundance of water, and
to divide the sulphur into small drops or portions, that the cooling
may be rapid. If it be poured in a mass, the interior cools slowly,
and acquires the ordinary hard state. When the experiment is
well made at 446°, the sulphur may be drawn into threads as fine
as a hair, and many feet in length.</p>

<p>M. Dumas, in remarking upon this curious effect of sudden
cooling, classes it with the similar effect which occurs with bronze.
Although difficult to assign the exact cause, yet he notices that the
tendency to crystallize can evidently be traced as influential over
some of the appearances, the hardness and opacity, for instance,
<span class="xxpn" id="p469">[p469]</span>
which always occur together when the crystalline state is assumed;
whereas, when rapid cooling has hindered crystallization, the mass
remains soft and transparent, until it crystallizes, which usually
happens in twenty or thirty hours.—<em class="italic">Ann. de Chimie</em>, xxxvi. 83.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>11. <em class="italic">On the Fluidity of Sulphur and Phosphorus at common temperatures</em>,
by Mr. Faraday.</h5>—I published some time ago a short account
of an instance of the existence of fluid sulphur at common temperatures<a id="fnanchor_130_94" href="#fn_130_94" class="fnanchor">130</a>;
and though I thought the fact curious, I did not esteem
it of such importance as to put more than my initials to the account.
I have just learned, through the <em class="italic">Bulletin Universel</em> for September,
p. 178<a id="fnanchor_131_95" href="#fn_131_95" class="fnanchor">131</a>, that Signor Bellani had observed the same fact in 1813,
and published it in the <em class="italic">Giornale di Fisica</em>, vol. vi. (old series). I
also learn, by the same means, that M. Bellani complains of the
manner in which facts and theories, which have been published by
him, are afterwards given by others as new discoveries; and
though I find myself classed with Gay-Lussac, Sir H. Davy,
Daniell, Bostock, &#38;c., in having thus erred, I shall not rest satisfied,
without making restitution, for M. Bellani, in this instance, certainly
deserves it at my hand.</div>

<p>Not being able to obtain access to the original journal, I shall
quote M. Bellani’s very curious experiments from the Bulletin,
in which they appear to be fully described. “The property which
water possesses, of retaining its fluid states, when in tranquillity, at
temperatures 10° or 15° below its freezing point, is well known; phosphorus
behaves in the same manner; sometimes its fluidity may be
retained at 13° (centigrade?) for a minute, an hour, or even many
days. What is singular is, that, though water cooled below its
freezing point, congeals easily upon slight internal movement, however
communicated, phosphorus, on the contrary, sometimes retains
its liquid state even at 3°, even though it be shaken in a
tube or poured upon cold water. But, as soon as it has acquired
the lowest temperature which it can bear without solidifying, the
moment it is touched with a body at the same temperature, it solidifies
so quickly, that the touching body cannot penetrate its mass.
If the smallest morsel of phosphorus is put into contact with a
liquified portion, the latter infallibly solidifies, though it be only a
single degree below the limit of temperature necessary; this does
not always happen when the body touching it is heterogeneous.</p>

<p>“Sulphur presented the same phenomena as phosphorus; fragments
of sulphur always produced the crystallization of cold fluid
portions. Having withdrawn the bulb of a thermometer which had
been plunged into sulphur at 120°, it came out covered with small
globules of sulphur, which remained fluid at 60°; and having
touched these one after another with a thread of glass, they became
solid: although several seemed in contact, yet it required that each
<span class="xxpn" id="p470">[p470]</span>
should be touched separately. A drop of sulphur, which was made
to move on the bulb of the thermometer, by turning the instrument
in a horizontal position, did not congeal until nearly at 30°; and
some drops were retained fluid at 15°, <em class="italic">i. e.</em> 75° of Reaumur below
the ordinary point of liquefaction.”</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Bulletin Universel</em> then proceeds to describe some late and
new experiments of M. Bellani, on the expansion in volume of a
cold dense solution of sulphate of soda during the solidification of
part of the salt in it. The general fact has, however, been long
and well known in this country and in France; and the particular
form of experiment described is with us a common lecture illustration.
The expansion, as ascertained by M. Bellani, is
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span><span class="fdn">87</span></span>
of the original volume of fluid.</p>

<p>According to the Bulletin, M. Bellani also claims, though certainly
in a much less decided manner than the above, the principal ideas
in a paper which I have published on the existence of a limit to vaporization,
and I referred back to the <em class="italic">Giornale di Fisica</em> for 1822,
(published prior to my paper,) for the purpose of rendering justice
in this case also. Here, however, the contact of our ideas is so
slight, and for so brief a time, that I shall leave the papers in the
hands of the public without further remarks. It is rather curious
to observe how our thoughts had been at the same time upon the
same subject. Being charged in the Bulletin with quoting an experiment
from a particular page in M. Bellani’s memoir, (which
I did from another journal, in which the experiment only was described,)
I turned to the original place, and there, though I found
the experiment I had transferred, I also found another which I had
previously made on the same subject, and which M. Bellani had
quoted.</p>

<p>I very fully join in the regret which the <em class="italic">Bulletin Universel</em>
expresses, that scientific men do not know more perfectly what has
been done, or what their companions are doing; but I am afraid
the misfortune is inevitable. It is certainly impossible for any person
who wishes to devote a portion of his time to chemical experiment,
to read all the books and papers that are published in connexion
with his pursuit; their number is immense, and the labour
of winnowing out the few experimental and theoretical truths which
in many of them are embarrassed by a very large proportion of uninteresting
matter, of imagination, and of error, is such, that most
persons who try the experiment are quickly induced to make a
selection in their reading, and thus inadvertently, at times, pass
by what is really good.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>12. <em class="italic">Separation of Selenium from Sulphur</em>.</h5>—Berzelius says, that
these substances, so much resembling each other in their general
properties, may be easily separated by the following process.
When sulphuret of selenium is fused with carbonate of potash,
the alkali not being excess, the fused mass, dissolved in water,
leaves selenium undissolved and free from sulphur.
<span class="xxpn" id="p471">[p471]</span></div>

<p>Some of the sulphuret of selenium from Lukawitz, in Bohemia,
was dissolved in potash, and the solution converted into hyposulphite
by exposure to the air at the temperature of 65° F.; 0.1125
of the sulphuret experimented with were precipitated, and found
to be <em class="italic">pure selenium</em>. The solution being of a deeper red colour
than that of the common sulphuret, a piece of sulphur was put
into it, and the whole boiled for a moment; a quarter of a grain of
selenium, perfectly free from sulphur, was precipitated.</p>

<p>A solution of a neutral seleniate, or of one with excess of base,
is soon rendered turbid by having sulphuretted hydrogen passed
through it. At first pure selenium separates; afterwards sulphuret
of selenium; and, lastly, mere sulphur. The solution should be
considerably diluted; when concentrated, the precipitate formed is
of a flame yellow colour, but soon becomes brownish-black, and
sulphur is deposited, sometimes crystallizing at the surface of the
deposite.—<em class="italic">Phil. Mag., N. S.</em>, ii. 390.</p>


<p>13. <em class="italic">On a new Compound of Selenium and Oxygen—Selenic Acid,
by</em> <span class="allcaps">MM</span>. Mitscherlich and Nitzsch.—This acid contains half as
much more oxygen as that discovered by M. Berzelius, and with
potash forms a neutral salt, having the same form and optical properties
as sulphate of potash, containing no water when crystallized,
and producing insoluble precipitates with barytic salts. The
acid is isomorphous with the sulphuric, and may with propriety be
called <em class="italic">selenic acid</em>, that described by M. Berzelius being considered
as the <em class="italic">selenious acid</em>.</p>

<p>The new acid is easily prepared: for this purpose selenium,
selenious acid, a selenite or a metallic selenuret is to be fused with
nitre. Selenuret of lead, being the most abundant source, has
been used for this purpose, but being accompanied by sulphuret,
the selenic acid is usually contaminated by sulphuric
acid. The selenuret of lead is to be freed from carbonates by
muriatic acid, and the residue mixed with its weight of nitrate of
soda, and thrown gradually into a red-hot crucible. Water then
dissolves out seleniate nitrate and nitrite of soda, no selenium
remaining in the residue. The solution quickly boiled, deposits
anhydrous seleniate of soda, and this being separated, by cooling
crystals of nitrate of soda are formed; these being removed, ebullition
again causes more seleniate to fall down, and proceeding in
this way an imperfect separation is effected. The seleniate, like
the sulphate of soda, is most soluble in water at 181°. To purify
the salt completely, the nitrite should be changed into nitrate by
nitric acid; but then sulphate of soda would remain as an impurity
formed from sulphuret in the ore, and no attempt to separate
this has as yet succeeded.</p>

<p>But if the seleniate of soda be mixed with muriate of ammonia
and heated, selenium, nitrogen and water come over, no trace of
sulphur appearing. The selenium may, however, be dissolved in
excess of nitric acid, and the selenious acid produced tested by
<span class="xxpn" id="p472">[p472]</span>
muriate of baryta, which would then separate sulphuric acid if
present; the clear solution is to be saturated with carbonate of soda,
evaporated to dryness, and the mixture of selenite and nitrate of
soda obtained, fuzed in a porcelain crucible over a spirit-lamp.
Then proceed by crystallization as before, and a pure seleniate of
soda will be produced.</p>

<p>To separate the selenic acid, the solution is to be decomposed by
nitrate of lead; the seleniate of lead is as insoluble as the sulphate,
and being well washed, is to be decomposed by a current of sulphuretted
hydrogen, which has no action on the selenic acid; the
solution being filtered, is to be boiled, and is then diluted selenic
acid. Its purity, as respects fixed bodies, is ascertained by its
entire volatility; if sulphuric acid be present, it may be ascertained
by boiling a portion with muriatic acid, which produces
selenious acid, and then testing by muriate of baryta, a precipitate
indicates sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>From the isomorphism of selenic acid and its salts with sulphuric
acid and its salts, M. Mitscherlich concluded, that the oxygen in
the acid should be to that in selenious acid as 3 to 2; and to that in
bases when it forms salt, as 3 to 1. These views were confirmed by
experiments. From the decomposition of seleniate of potash by
muriate of baryta, it appeared that the seleniate was composed of</p>

<p>According to Berzelius, selenious acid consists of 100 selenium,
and 40.33 oxygen; and supposing this contains two-thirds the
oxygen in selenic acid, the latter should consist of 62.32 and
37.68. From the analysis above given of the seleniate of potash,
it is evident that 100 of selenic acid saturates a quantity of base
captaining 12.56 of oxygen, which would agree with the latter
estimate of selenic acid.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Selenic acid</em> is a colourless liquid, which may be heated to 536°,
without sensible decomposition; above that it changes, and is,
rapidly resolved into oxygen and selenious acid at 554°. Heated to
329°, its specific gravity is 2.524; at 512°.6 it is 2.6; at 509° it is
2.625; but by that time selenious acid has been formed in it. A
portion of concentrated acid, from which the selenious acid had
<span class="xxpn" id="p473">[p473]</span>
been removed, consisted of 84.21 selenic acid, and 15.75 water;
but it is certain that the selenic acid begins to decompose before it
has resigned the last portions of water.</p>

<p>Selenic acid has a powerful attraction for water, and evolves
much heat when mixed with it. It is not decomposed by sulphuretted
hydrogen; so that the latter body may be used to decompose
the seleniates of lead and copper. When boiled with muriatic
acid it produces selenious acid and chlorine, and the mixture, like
aqua regia, will dissolve gold or platina. Selenic acid dissolves
zinc and iron, evolving hydrogen; it dissolves copper, evolving
selenious acid; and it dissolves gold, but not platina. Sulphurous
acid has no action on selenic acid, but instantly decomposes the
selenious acid. A solution containing selenic acid is easily decomposed,
by first boiling it with muriatic acid, and then adding
sulphurous acid.</p>

<p>Selenic acid is but little inferior to sulphuric acid in its affinity
for bases; seleniate of baryta is not completely decomposed by
sulphuric acid. Its combinations being isomorphous with those
of sulphuric acid, and possessing the same crystalline forms, and
the same general chemical properties, present but very slight,
though very interesting differences from the sulphates. These will
be resumed by M. Mitscherlich in a future memoir, with the
express object of illustrating the theory of Isomorphism.—<em class="italic">Ann. de
Chimie</em>, xxxvi. 100.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>
14. <em class="italic">Preparation of Hyposulphuric Acid</em>.</h5>—According to M.
Heeren, to obtain the greatest quantity of this acid in the process
of passing sulphurous acid over black oxide of manganese, the
temperature should be low, and the oxide finely divided. The
largest portion of hyposulphuric acid is formed at the commencement
of the operation.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>
15. <em class="italic">Singular Habitude of Phosphoric Acid with Albumen</em>.</h5>—<span class="allcaps">MM</span>.
Berzelius and Englehart differed in their results respecting the
effect of phosphoric acid on albumen; the latter found the acid
caused precipitation of the substance, the former the reverse. Fortunately
coming into company, they made some experiments, and
discovered a very singular property of the acid. The acid in Berzelius’s
laboratory not precipitating albumen, Dr. Englehart prepared
a fresh portion from phosphorus and nitric acid, evaporating
the solution in a platina vessel, and heating it to redness. This
acid, dissolved in water, precipitated both animal and vegetable
albumen abundantly. Another portion of acid, prepared by burning
phosphorus in air, also precipitated albumen. After many experiments
to discover the cause of difference in the acids, Dr. Englehart
remarked, that the two acids he had prepared, gradually
lost their power of precipitating albumen, and in some days were
like the acid of Berzelius. This change took place both in open
and closed vessels, and was not at all hastened by ebullition.
<span class="xxpn" id="p474">[p474]</span>
Upon evaporating the acid, and heating it to redness, it recovered
its precipitating power, but gradually lost it again by a day’s
repose. The cause of this difference escaped detection; it evidently
does not depend upon a difference of oxidation. “May it not be
supposed,” says Berzelius, “that there exists a chemical combination
of phosphoric acid with water, which is not formed until some
time after solution, and which is incapable of precipitating albumen?”—<em class="italic">Annales
de Chimie</em>, xxxvi. 110.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>16. <em class="italic">Economical Preparation
of Deutoxide of Barium</em>.</h5>—This
process is due to M. Quesneville. Nitrate of baryta is to be put
into a luted earthenware retort, to which a tube is to be attached
for the purpose of conveying the liberated gases to a water-trough.
The retort is to be gradually heated to redness, and retained at that
temperature as long as nitrous acid and azotic gas pass over; the
evolution of these substances indicates that nitrate of baryta still
remains to be decomposed, but the instant that pure oxygen gas
passes off, the fire is to be removed and the retort cooled. The
product of this decomposition is a peroxide of barium; it falls to
pieces in water, without producing heat, disengages oxygen when
boiled with water, and is reduced to a protoxide by a strong heat.
When acted upon by sulphuric acid, no nitric acid was evolved;
and when subjected to nitric acid, no nitric oxide was produced.
The production of this peroxide is easily understood, for the protoxide
formed by the decomposition of the nitrate being in contact,
at a red heat, with a large quantity of oxygen in a nascent state,
combines with it, and is retained, unless the heat be so high as to
decompose it.—<em class="italic">Annales de Chimie</em>, xxxvi. 108.</div>

<p>The decomposition and effect are precisely the same as those
lately pointed out by Mr. Phillips as occurring with potassium when
the nitrate of potash is decomposed by heat.—See p. 483 of the last
volume of this Journal.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>
17. <em class="italic">Preparation of Aluminum—Chloride of Aluminum</em>.</h5>—According
to the accounts published, the following process has succeeded in
the hands of M. Oersted, in decomposing alumina and evolving the
base <em class="italic">aluminum</em>. Pure alumina is to be heated to redness, and then
well mixed with pulverized charcoal; the mixture is to be placed in
a porcelain tube, and being heated to redness, is to have dry chlorine
gas passed over it; the charcoal reduces the alumina, the base
combines with the chlorine, and oxide of carbon is formed. The
chloride of aluminum is soft, crystalline, and evaporates at a temperature
a little above 212° Fahrenheit: it readily attracts moisture
from the atmosphere, and becomes hot when water is added to it.
Being mixed with an amalgam of potassium, containing much of
the latter metal, and immediately heated, chloride of potassium is
formed, and the metallic base of the alumina combines with the
mercury. The amalgam quickly oxidises by exposure to air; but
being heated out of contact with the atmosphere, the mercury is
<span class="xxpn" id="p475">[p475]</span>
volatilized, and a metallic button is left, having the colour and
splendour of tin. A fuller account of the researches of M. Oersted
on this subject is expected.—Hensmann’s <em class="italic">Repertoire—Phil. Mag.
N. S.</em> ii.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>
18. <em class="italic">Mutual Action of Lime and Litharge</em>.</h5>—M. Fournet heated
a mixture consisting of 7.12 parts of calcined lime, and 27.89 parts
of litharge, very strongly; a coherent mass was obtained, which,
pulverized and digested in water, gave, when filtered, a perfectly
clear and colourless liquor, which, when treated with sulphuretted
hydrogen, threw down an abundant black precipitate: hence oxide
of lead is rendered soluble in water by means of lime.—<em class="italic">Ann. des
Mines</em>, i. 538.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>
19. <em class="italic">New Chloride of Manganese discovered by</em> M. J. Dumas.</h5>—This
chloride corresponds in proportions to the manganesic acid,
and in contact with water, produces muriatic and manganesic acids.
It is easily obtained by putting a solution of manganesic acid into
contact with concentrated sulphuric acid, and fused common salt.
Water and the new chloride are formed; the former is retained by
the acid, the latter volatilizes in a gaseous form. The body does not,
however, appear to constitute a permanent gas<a id="fnanchor_132_96" href="#fn_132_96" class="fnanchor">132</a>, for though, when
produced, it appears as an elastic fluid having a cupreous or greenish
tint, yet when passed into a tube, cooled to 5° or 4° Fahrenheit,
it condenses into a liquid of a brownish green colour.</div>

<p>When the perchloride is produced in a large tube, its vapour
gradually displaces the air present, and the tube becomes filled
with it; if it then be poured into a jar with moistened sides, the
colour of the gas changes as it comes into contact with the moist
air; a thick smoke of a fine rose colour appears; and the sides of
the vessel acquire a deep purple colour due to the manganesic acid
formed. The water thus coloured is abundantly precipitated by
nitrate of silver, and, acted upon by a solution of potash, produces
all the changes of the mineral chamelion.</p>

<p>The most simple process for the preparation of this body appears
to be to form a common green chamelion, to convert it into red
chamelion by sulphuric acid, and to evaporate the solution, which
will give a residue consisting of sulphate and manganesate of
potash. This mixture, acted upon by concentrated sulphuric acid,
produces the solution of manganesic acid, into which the common
salt is to be thrown in small pieces, until the vapours which rise are
colourless; the latter effect is a sign that all the manganesic acid is
decomposed, and that muriatic acid only is produced.</p>

<p>An analogous compound is formed when a fluoride is used in
place of the common salt. But all attempts as yet made to collect
a sufficient quantity for examination have failed; the chloride, on
the contrary, is easily formed and examined, although it is not so
easy to preserve it.—<em class="italic">Annales de Chimie</em>, xxxvi. 81.

20. <em class="italic">Preparation of pure Oxide of Zinc, by</em> M. Hermann.</h5>—It is
by no means easy to obtain this substance perfectly pure; the following
is M. Hermann’s process: Oxide of zinc, or metallic zinc, is
to be dissolved in excess of sulphuric acid, and the solution being
filtered, sulphuretted hydrogen is to be passed through, so long
as a brown or yellow precipitate is formed. Cadmium, lead, or
copper, being thus separated, and the solution filtered, it is to be
treated with solution of the chloride of lime, (bleaching powder,)
by which the iron and manganese will be separated. The solution,
again filtered, is then to be crystallized in porcelain vessels, by
which sulphate of lime is rejected, and a mother liquor separated,
which usually contains cobalt and nickel. The crystals of sulphate
of zinc are to be dissolved in as small a quantity of cold water as
possible, and the sulphate of lime filtered out; then the solution,
being rendered more dilute, is to be decomposed by carbonate of
soda in slight excess, and the precipitate well washed, dried, and
heated to redness: it is then a perfectly pure and beautifully white
oxide.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em> A. viii. 263.</div>

22. <em class="italic">Separation of Bismuth from Mercury by Potassium</em>.</h5>—M.
Serullas has pointed a striking instance of the separation of bismuth
from mercury. He says a twelve hundred thousandth, and even less
of bismuth, when dissolved in mercury, may be separated and
rendered visible by the addition of a certain quantity of the amalgam
of potassium and a little water. A black powder is observed
to rise from the substance of the metal, and is a mixture of bismuth
and mercury in a very divided state; it rises to the surface or adheres
to the vessels.</div>

<p>Copper, lead, tin, and silver, are equally separated, but not so
promptly, or so evidently to the eye as bismuth; for they are not
associated with divided mercury, at the time of their separation, like
the latter: with bismuth a mere atom is rendered visible, and M.
Serullas thinks that chemistry does not present a more delicate test
than the amalgam of potassium for bismuth in mercury.—<em class="italic">Annales

23. <em class="italic">Sulphuret of Arsenic proportionate in Composition to Arsenic
Acid</em>.</h5>—M. Pfaff acted upon arsenious acid by nitro-muriatic acid,
and obtained a pure arsenic acid soluble in water, and deliquescent
in the air. This, dissolved in 40 parts of water, had a current
of sulphuretted hydrogen passed through it, which instantly
produced a yellow orange precipitate of a pulverulent form, continuing
identical in composition, until no further precipitate was
<span class="xxpn" id="p477">[p477]</span>
occasioned. The fluid was then perfectly free from arsenic. The
precipitate was pure sulphuret of arsenic, soluble in ammonia
when slightly heated, and composed of equal parts of sulphur and
the metal.</div>

<p>M. Pfaff further says that arsenic acid may be separated from its
combinations with bases, by dissolving the arseniates in nitric acid,
and passing sulphuretted hydrogen through the solution; an abundant
precipitate of sulphuret of arsenic is formed, containing no trace
of the base of the arseniate decomposed.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em> A. viii. 256.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>
24. <em class="italic">New Double Chromates</em>.</h5>—Mr. Stokes has obtained several
new salts, by mixing chromate of potash with metallic sulphates.
Chromate of potash, mixed with sulphate of zinc, gave a precipitate
of chromate of zinc; and the mother liquor, by concentration, yielded
certain yellow crystals in the form of a flat rhombic prism, which
Dr. Thomson had mistaken for impure sulphate of zinc, but which
Mr. Stokes recognised as a new compound: 50 grains gave 18.33
sulphuric acid; 0.18 chromic acid; 9.87 oxide of zinc; 8.91 potash;
12.6 water: 0.11 loss.</div>

<p>Chromate of potash and sulphate of nickel were mixed in atomic
proportions, and the solutions heated; after the chromate of nickel
was separated, they were evaporated to dryness. The residuum, digested
in water, was filtered, and the deep red solution obtained upon
cooling, yielded grass green crystals in the form of oblique rhombic
prisms; 50 grains of these, when analysed, gave 12.26 sulphuric
acid; 0.978 chromic acid; 8.2 oxide of nickel; 9.862 potash;
12.7 water.</p>

<p>A similar salt may be obtained by mixing chromate of potash
and sulphate of copper. It is of a light green colour, and has precisely
the same form as the salts already described. In every case
crystals of bichromate of potash were produced in the second crop
crystals.—<em class="italic">Phil. Mag. N. S.</em> ii. 427.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>
25. <em class="italic">Dobereiner’s finely divided Platina</em>.</h5>—The following is M.
Dobereiner’s process for obtaining finely divided platina, fit for the
performance of the experiment which he first made on the combination
of oxygen and hydrogen, at common temperatures. Mix
muriate of platina with a solution of neutral tartrate of soda in a
glass tube, half or three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and twenty
or thirty inches in length, and apply heat until the fluid becomes
slightly turbid; afterwards expose it for several days to the sun’s
rays. The greater part of the platina will separate from the solution,
and be deposited in minute laminæ, of a greyish black
colour on the sides of the glass; the tube and its contents are to
be put into a glass vessel containing water, and it is to be filled
with hydrogen gas; the platina becomes almost immediately white
and shining like silver, and may then be readily detached from the
glass. During the reduction of the platina the tartaric acid is partly
converted into carbonic and formic acids. “As the inflammation
<span class="xxpn" id="p478">[p478]</span>
of the hydrogen,” it is said, “is caused by abstracting a portion
of the caloric from the oxygen, effected by the platina, the
smaller the laminæ of the metal are, the more readily is the incandescence
produced.” Spongy platina for the lamps for instantaneous
light, is prepared of great power, by moistening the muriate of ammonia
and platina with a concentrated solution of ammonia; the
paste formed is to be heated to redness in an earthen or platina
crucible.—<em class="italic">Hensman’s Repertoire—Phil. Mag. N. S.</em> ii. 388.</div>

26. <em class="italic">New Metals</em>.</h5>—Professor Osann, of Dorpat, is said to have
discovered three new metals in the crude platina, obtained from
the Uralian mountains. One, which has occurred only in one specimen
of the ore, resembles osmium in some of its compounds.
The second forms white acicular crystals from a nitro-muriatic acid
solution; these, when heated, being softened and reduced. The
third is insoluble in nitro-muriatic acid, and, by a particular process
yields a dark green-coloured oxide. The account as yet given
of these substances is not precise enough to allow of any judgment
respecting their claim to the character of new metals.</div>

28. <em class="italic">On the Composition of simple Alimentary Substances, by</em>
Dr. Prout.</h5>—It is well known that Dr. Prout has of late years
devoted that portion of his attention which he gives to chemistry,
exclusively to the consideration of organized substances, with the
important object of making the knowledge he might obtain subservient
to the study of physiology and pathology; and during the
last session of the Royal Society, a paper by this philosopher was
read, containing many important and apparently accurate results
relative to the particular subjects which he has pursued; some
account of which we are desirous of giving in this place.</div>

<p>Dr. Prout’s first object was to devise, if possible, an unexceptionable
mode of determining the proportions of the three or four
principles, which, with few exceptions, form organic bodies; and
after numerous trials, he adopted a method founded upon the following
well known principles. When an organic product, containing
three elements, hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen, is burnt in
oxygen gas, one of three things must happen: i. The original
bulk of oxygen gas may remain the same, in which case the hydrogen
and oxygen in the substance must exist in it in the same proportions
in which they exist in water; or, ii. The original bulk
of the oxygen may be increased, in which case the oxygen must
exist in the substance in a greater proportion than it exists in
water; or, iii. The original bulk of the oxygen gas may be
diminished; in which case the hydrogen must predominate.
Hence it is obvious, that, in the first of these cases, the composition
of a substance may be determined, by simply ascertaining the
quantity of carbonic acid gas yielded by a known quantity of it;
while, in the other two, the same can be readily ascertained by
means of the same data, and by noting the excess or diminution of
the original bulk of the oxygen gas employed.</p>

<p>The apparatus consists of two inverted glass syphons which act
the part of gasometers; these are connected when required, by a
small green glass tube, in which the substance is to be decomposed
and burnt: the syphons are very carefully gradated; so that the
quantity of gas in them can be accurately estimated; and are supplied
with cocks both above and below, so that they can be filled
with mercury, the mercury drawn off and gas introduced, the gas
transferred through the green glass tube, or the contents retained
in an undisturbed state, with the utmost readiness and ease. The
substance to be decomposed, may be put into a platina tray, and
introduced alone into the green glass tube, and being there heated
by a spirit lamp, be burnt in the gas passing over it; or it may
be mixed with pure siliceous sand; or, what is most generally preferable,
be mixed with peroxide of copper, which is always left, in
consequence of the excess of oxygen gas used, in the state in which
it was introduced. After the experiment the volume of gas is easily
<span class="xxpn" id="p481">[p481]</span>
corrected for pressure, and if necessary for temperature, and the
carbonic acid ascertained by the removal and analysis of a portion.
No correction is required for moisture, the gas always being used
saturated with water.</p>

<p>Dr. Prout considers the principal alimentary substances as reducible
to three great classes, the <em class="italic">saccharine</em>, the <em class="italic">oily</em>, and the <em class="italic">albuminous</em>;
and his paper relates to the first of these. This, with
certain exceptions, includes the substances in which, according to
<span class="allcaps">MM</span>. Gay Lussac and Thenard, the oxygen and hydrogen are in
the same proportion as in water. Such substances are principally
derived from the vegetable kingdom, and being at the same time
<em class="italic">alimentary</em>, Dr. Prout uses the terms <em class="italic">saccharine principle</em> and
<em class="italic">vegetable aliment</em> as synonymous.</p>

<p>The following tables show some of Dr. Prout’s results with several
substances, extreme care having been taken in every case to obtain
the bodies pure, and new processes often resorted to for that
purpose.</p>

29. <em class="italic">Preparation of Sulphate of Quinia and Kinic Acid, without
the use of Alcohol</em>.</h5>—The following is the process of <span class="allcaps">MM</span>. Henry
and Plisson: About two pounds of bark are to be coarsely powdered
and boiled with water, acidulated with sulphuric acid in the usual
manner. When the hot liquors are cleared, recently prepared and
moist hydrate of lead is to be added until the fluid is neutral, and
has acquired a faint yellow colour; this must be done carefully,
lest too much hydrate of lead be added. As the decoloration of
the decoction is necessary, the liquid, if it remains turbid until the
next morning, must have a little more hydrate added and be re-filtered,
but the operation is rarely subject to this inconvenience,
being usually finished in a few hours. The yellow liquid contains
a little kinate of lead, much kinate of lime, kinate of quinia or
cinchonia, a little colouring matter, and traces of other substances.
The washed deposite consists of colouring matter, combined with
oxide of lead, sulphate of lead, and a portion of free quinia;
contains no sub-kinate of lead.</div>

<p>The lead, dissolved in the fluid, is to be separated by a few drops
of sulphuric acid, or a small current of sulphuretted hydrogen, and
the filtered liquid is to be precipitated by adding caustic lime, previously
mixed into a thin paste with water, until the earth is in
very slight excess; in this manner the quinia is precipitated. The
addition of sulphuric acid readily converts this quinia into sulphate,
<span class="xxpn" id="p483">[p483]</span>
which may be obtained in very white and silky crystals. The fluid
left after the separation of the quinia, contains a kinate of lime
almost pure. Being evaporated until of the consistence of syrup,
it readily crystallizes in a mass, which may then be purified by
recrystallization. The kinate of lime may be precipitated by means
of alcohol, and then be crystallized after solution in water or diluted
alcohol; or, by adding oxalic acid drop by drop, according to the
directions of M. Vauquelin, the lime may be separated and kinic
acid obtained. Two thirds of the quinia or cinchonia in a specimen
of bark may be thus separated, and with such facility as to offer a
ready test of the presence of these alkalies in any wood or bark
submitted to examination.—<em class="italic">Ann. de Chimie</em>, xxxv., 166.</p>

<div class="h5d"><h5>
30. <em class="italic">Pure Narcotine prepared</em>.</h5>—The following process is that
practised by Mr. Carpenter. Digest one ounce of coarsely powdered
opium in one pint of ether for ten days, frequently submitting
it to ebullition in a water bath; separate the ether and add fresh
portions until the opium is exhausted; place the ethereal solution
in a wide-mouthed bottle, and, covering the mouth with bibulous
paper, allow the ether to evaporate spontaneously, but slowly; as
the fluid diminishes, it leaves the sides of the bottle coated with
crystals of narcotine; as the solution becomes more dense, the
crystals enlarge and accumulate, and the bottom of the vessel is
covered with large transparent crystals, accompanied with a brown
viscid liquor and extract, which contains an acid resin, caoutchouc,
&#38;c. Separate these substances and wash the crystals in successive
portions of cold ether to remove the extract; then dissolve them
in warm ether, and evaporate slowly as before; beautiful snow
white crystals of pure narcotine will be obtained: those on the sides
of the vessel assume plumose and arborescent forms; they enlarge
as the solution becomes more concentrated, and the bottom of the
bottle becomes covered with pure narcotine, assuming the rhomboidal
prismatic form with some modifications of maccled crystals.
The crystals towards the bottom are transparent, but the most
minute at the top are opaque and snow white. By picking out the
largest and most regular crystals, again dissolving and evaporating,
and repeating the same process, each time selecting the largest and
best crystals, some were obtained the eighth of an inch in diameter,
and still larger might be produced by similar operations.—<em class="italic">Silliman’s

32. <em class="italic">Preparation of pure Mellitic Acid, by</em> M. Wöhler.</h5>—Concentrated
solution of carbonate of ammonia was poured upon finely
pulverised mellite, and boiled until the excess of ammonia was
<span class="xxpn" id="p484">[p484]</span>
dissipated; the solution was filtered and left to crystallize. The
pure crystals, being dissolved in water, were precipitated by acetate
of lead, and the mellitate of lead, after being well washed was decomposed
by sulphuretted hydrogen; being filtered, the solution was
evaporated to dryness, during which the mellitic acid precipitated
as a white powder; being dissolved in cold alcohol, and left to
evaporate spontaneously, the acid was obtained in acicular crystals.
In this state it is very acid, unaltered by air, very soluble in water
and alcohol, and sustains a considerable heat without change; it
does not fuze, but ultimately sublimes, though probably not without
decomposition. When boiled for a considerable time with alcohol,
it undergoes a peculiar change, and occasions the production of a
new acid substance, resembling the benzoic acid.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>
33. <em class="italic">On a New Acid existing in Iceland Moss</em>.</h5>—The reddish
purple colour which is produced by adding a decoction of Iceland
moss to per-salts of iron, has been attributed to the presence of
gallic acid, but is found by M. Pfaff to be occasioned by a new acid
body which may be separated in the following manner. A pound
of the lichen cut small is to be macerated in solution of carbonate
of potassa, until all that is soluble is separated; the above quantity
will neutralize two gros<a id="fnanchor_133_97" href="#fn_133_97" class="fnanchor">133</a> of the carbonate. The filtered liquor is
to be precipitated by acetate of lead, and the brown precipitate
produced, when well washed, is to be diffused through water, and
sulphuretted hydrogen passed through it until all the lead is separated.
The filtered liquor is acid, and by spontaneous evaporation,
yields dendritic crystals. The crystals, when heated, carbonize,
but produce no odour like that of tartaric acid, and lime is left.
If they be dissolved and acted upon by alkaline carbonates, carbonate
of lime is thrown down, and alkaline salts, containing the
new acid, are produced.</div>

<p>The potash salt crystallizes in quadrilateral prisms, needles or
plates, and is not deliquescent. The soda salt has similar characters,
and the ammonia salt crystallizes in needles. These salts
abundantly precipitate the acetate and muriate of iron of a red
brown colour; they precipitate sulphate and nitrate of zinc white;
muriate of manganese slightly of a clear brown colour; barytic and
strontian salts abundantly white; being mixed with strong solutions
of muriate or acetate of lime, they gradually produce an acicular
crystalline white precipitate; acetate of silver yields an abundant
white precipitate, which does not change colour in less than
twenty-four hours: they do not precipitate salts of glucina, magnesia,
alumine, uranium, nickel, copper, cobalt, gold or platina.
This substance has been named the lichenic acid, and is distinguished
from boletic acid by the different character of its vapour,
and by forming an insoluble salt with baryta.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em>

<p class="continue">The muscular fibre, nitre and iron filings were beat into a mass,
and partially dried by a moderate heat; they were then returned to
the mortar and reduced to a perfectly homogeneous greyish white
powder. This was dried and weighed, and appeared to be reduced
to nearly equal parts of nitrate of potash and animal fibre.</p>

<p>The desiccation having completed by a very moderate heat on
a sand bath, will not, as far as I am aware, differ materially from that
produced by exposing the mass in “an airy situation to dry,” as
nitrate of potash undergoes no decomposition by admixture with
animal matters at a low temperature.</p>

<p>When the desiccation was completed, the mixture was charged
into an iron cylinder, placed in the sand-bath, and though combustion
was not anticipated in this part of the process, yet the mouth
of the cylinder was turned towards the wall, lest an accident should
occur, (which appeared to me to be more than probable in some stage
of the process.) In about two hours after the cylinder had been
heated, I was surprised to see its contents ejected with considerable
force, in a state of brilliant combustion. Supposing something in the
above experiment had been overlooked, and that, if the materials
had been longer in contact previously to subjecting them to complete
desiccation, this inflammation would not have taken place, the
experiment was repeated with the following precautions: after the
muscular fibre had been subjected to the action of the pestle in
combination with the prescribed quantity of nitrate of potash, the
mass was boiled with water for some hours, and then gently evaporated
to dryness; even now, by applying a piece of red-hot
charcoal, it was found that the nitre was in a condition to enter
<span class="xxpn" id="p486">[p486]</span>
into active combustion, and if the cylinder had been again charged
and subjected to a temperature capable of producing ignition, there
cannot be a doubt, but that a similar inflammation would have taken
place.</p>

<p>However this might be, this quantity of material was now
mixed with hydrate of potash to an equal weight with the nitre
used; and the mass subjected to the heat of a sand-bath for some
hours, and afterwards submitted to the action of a naked fire for
rather more than an hour, and the heat brought up to redness.
No considerable action took place, but some particles of the carbonaceous
matter were ejected, and produced brilliant scintillations
in the fire, so that we may conclude, notwithstanding the presence
of so large a quantity of potash, the properties of the nitre were not
destroyed.</p>

1. <em class="italic">Squalls of Wind on the African Shores</em>.</h5>—The following
description is by D. M. Milnegraden, from the relations of his
father. “The approach of the squall is generally foreboded by the
appearance of jet black clouds over the land, moving in a direction
towards the sea, at the same time that a gentle breeze blows
towards the shore. In these circumstances, the precaution which
my father usually adopted, was to take in immediately all sail, so
as to leave the ship under bare poles, and send the whole of the
crew below decks. As the tornado approaches nearer, the rain is
observed to be gushing down in torrents, and the lightning darting
down from the clouds with such profusion, as to resemble continued
showers of electric matter. When, however, the squall
comes within the distance of about half a mile from the ship, these
electric appearances altogether cease; the rain only continues in the
same manner. As the tornado is passing over the ship, a loud crackling
noise is distinctly heard among the rigging, occasioned by the
electric matter streaming down the masts, whose points serve to
attract it, and I think that I have been told, that when this phenomenon
takes place at night, a glimmering of light is observed over
every part of the rigging. But when the squall has removed to
about half a mile beyond the ship, exactly the same appearances
return by which the squall was characterised in coming off the
shore, and before reaching the same distance from the ship. The
lightning is again seen to be descending in continued sheets and in
such abundance as even to resemble the torrents of rain themselves
which accompany the squall. These squalls take place every day
during a certain season of the year called the Harmatan season.
The jet black clouds begin to appear moving from the mountains
about nine in the morning, and reach the sea about two in the
afternoon. Another very singular fact attending these tornados is,
that, after they have moved out eight or nine leagues to sea, where
<span class="xxpn" id="p487">[p487]</span>
they become apparently expended, the lightning is seen to rise up
from the sea. The violence of the wind during the continuance
of the storm is excessive.”—<em class="italic">Jameson’s

2. <em class="italic">Destruction of an Oak by Lightning</em>.</h5>—M. Muncke describes
a case in which an oak, being struck by lightning, was rent and
destroyed in an extraordinary manner. The trunk of the tree was
about fifteen feet in height, a foot and a half or two feet in diameter
at the branches, and three feet in diameter at the root. The top
of the tree was separated as if by the stroke of a hatchet, and without
any appearance of carbonization: the trunk was torn into a
thousand pieces, exceedingly small in size when compared with
the original mass, and thrown to a great distance. The division
and destruction was such as to sustain the thought, that in certain
cases the lightning might cause the entire dispersion of the tree,
an opinion which was suggested by the circumstance that lightning
which had fallen at Le Chateau de Marbourg left no traces of a
rafter that had occurred in its course.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em> A. viii. 194.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>
3. <em class="italic">Description of a Meteoric Fire-Ball seen at New Haven by
the Rev. S. E. Dwight</em>.</h5>—The meteor appeared on Saturday evening,
March 21, 1813, a little before ten o’clock. The sky was much
overcast, but the covering thin, and the stars were in full view
towards the north where the meteor appeared. Dr. Dwight was
standing on a platform on the north side of the house looking
eastward, when the light first broke upon him, and for a moment
supposed it to be lightning, but was instantly induced by its continuance
to look at the luminary. The following are the observations
made at the time.</div>

<p>i. The meteor was at first about 35° above the horizon, and,
judging from the course of a fence near at hand, its direction about
N. 20°. E.</p>

<p>ii. Its figure nearly that of an ellipse, with the ends in a slight
degree sharpened or angular.</p>

<p>iii. The length of its transverse diameter appeared to be about
equal to the apparent diameter of the moon when on the meridian,
and that of the conjugate about three fourths of the transverse.</p>

<p>iv. The colour rather more yellow than that of the moon.</p>

<p>v. A tail of light, ten or twelve degrees in length, was formed
behind it; broadest near the body; decreasing in breadth very
slowly for about two-fifths of its length, after which it was uniform,
and about as wide as the apparent diameter of Venus.
The direction of the tail was coincident with that of the transverse
diameter.</p>

<p>vi. The ball was far more luminous than the tail, and the part
connected with the tail scarcely less distinct than the opposite part.</p>

<p>vii. The light was such that all objects cast distinct shadows,
though less strongly marked than when the moon is full.</p>

<p>viii. Numerous sparks continually issued from the ball of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p488">[p488]</span>
meteor; they were of the apparent size, but much more brilliant
than the smaller stars, and after descending a little distance, disappeared.</p>

<p>ix. The meteor was visible for about eight or perhaps ten seconds.</p>

<p>x. A second or two before its disappearance, three much larger
sparks or luminous fragments were thrown off at once, two of them
the apparent size of Venus, the third larger. These were the last
pieces which were seen to leave the body. Their paths were at
first nearly parallel with that of the meteor, yet beneath it. From
this direction, however, they all deviated constantly and rapidly, in
parabolic curves, until they seemed falling perpendicularly towards
the earth. Each fragment became less and less distinct until it
disappeared. The largest continued visible until about 20° from
the horizon.</p>

<p>xi. The meteor itself disappeared as suddenly as if, in one indivisible
moment, it had passed into a medium absolutely opaque,
or as if, at a given moment, it had left the atmosphere; but a few
moments afterwards there was a distinct and somewhat extensive
illumination over that part of the sky for about a second.</p>

<p>xii. When the meteor disappeared, it was about 30° above the
horizon in the direction of N. 45° E. or 25° east of the place
where it was first seen. The direction of the path was probably
from W. by S. to E. by N. The meteor was obviously going
from the observer, its path making an angle with the optic axis of
about 60°.</p>

<p>xiii. Between eight and ten minutes after the disappearance of
the meteor, there was a loud and heavy report, accompanied by a
very sensible jar; it did not much resemble either thunder or the
report of a cannon, but was louder, shorter, and sharper than
either, and was followed by no perceptible echo.</p>

<p>xiv. A friend of Dr. Dwight’s, who was in Berlin at the time,
about twenty-three miles due N. of Newhaven, saw the meteor
distinctly, but made no particular observations. His account accorded
generally with that given; but the meteor appeared to him
larger, more elevated, and somewhat more to the east in its apparent
place. No account could be obtained of any fragments which
had fallen from it.—<em class="italic">Silliman’s Journal</em>, xiii. 35.</p>

4. <em class="italic">Remarkable Meteoric Phenomenon, described by</em> Chladni.</h5>—A
noise, resembling thunder in its rolling nature, was heard at Saarbruck
and the environs, about four o’clock on the 1st of April,
1826, the atmosphere being clear, and the sun shining brightly.
During the sound, a greyish object, apparently about three feet
and a half in height, was seen in the air, rapidly approaching the
earth, and there expanding itself like a sheet; there was then
silence for about a minute, after which another sound, resembling
thunder, was heard, as if it had originated at the place where the
meteor fell. Nothing was found when the place was afterwards
examined.—<em class="italic">Bull. Univ.</em> A. viii. 143.

5. <em class="italic">Aurora Borealis seen in the Day-time at Canonmills</em>.</h5>—The
morning of Sunday, September 9th, was rainy, with a light gale
from the N.E. Before mid-day the wind began to veer to the
west, and the clouds in the north-western horizon cleared away:
the blue sky in that quarter assumed the form of the segment of
a very large circle, with a well-defined line, the clouds above continuing
dense, and covering the rest of the heavens. The centre of
the azure arch gradually inclined more to the north, and reached
an elevation of nearly 20°. In a short time very thin fleecy clouds
began to rise from the horizon within the blue arch; and through
these very faint perpendicular streaks, of a sort of milky light,
could be perceived shooting; the eye being thus guided, could
likewise detect the same pale streaks passing over the intense
azure arch, but they were extremely slight and evanescent. Between
nine and ten in the evening of the same day, the aurora
borealis was very brilliant: so that there is no reason to doubt
that the azure arch in the morning, and the pale light seen shooting
across it, were connected with the same phenomenon.—<em class="italic">Jameson’s
Jour.</em> 1827, p. 378.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>
6. <em class="italic">Aurora Borealis in Siberia</em>.</h5>—Baron Wrangle says, that in
Siberia, when shooting stars pass across the space occupied by
polar lights, fiery beams suddenly arise in the place traversed by
the shooting star: further, that when a polar beam rises high
towards the zenith, the full moon also being high, it gradually
forms a luminous circle around the moon, at a distance of 20° or
30° from her, remains in this form for a short time, and then disappears.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>
7. <em class="italic">On the Presence of Ammonia in Argillaceous Minerals</em>.</h5>—Being
engaged in the examination of different specimens of gypsum,
M. Bouis observed, that traces of ammonia were evident in one
containing much argillaceous matter. The peculiar odour common
to argillaceous minerals when breathed upon, was very striking in
this specimen of gypsum; when a portion of it was moistened with
solution of potash, and muriatic acid brought near, white vapours
were produced, and reddened litmus paper was very quickly rendered
of a blue colour in its vicinity.</div>

<p>It was now suspected that all mineral substances, emitting an
argillaceous odour, contained ammonia; a great number of specimens
were tried, being moistened with solution of caustic potash,
and examined by litmus paper. In no case was ammonia absent,
and with common clay it continued to be evolved for more than two
days. Amongst the substances tried, were pipe clay, other clays,
numerous gypsums, Paris plaster, steatite, &#38;c. The antiquity of
the mineral seemed to have no relation to the ammonia.</p>

<p>M. Bouis concludes that, in all cases, the argillaceous smell of
minerals is connected with, and dependent upon, the presence of
ammonia, the latter being the vehicle of this particular odour.—<em class="italic">Annales

carefully the celebrated Petroleum Wells, near which they remained
for eight days, owing to the accident of the steam-vessel taking the
ground in their vicinity. Some of the wells are from thirty-seven to
fifty-three fathoms in depth, and are said to yield at an average,
daily, from 130 to 185 gallons of the earth-oil. The wells are
scattered over an area of about sixteen square miles. The wells are
private property, the owners paying a tax of five per cent. of the
produce to the state. This commodity is almost universally used
by the Burmans as lamp oil. Its price on the spot does not, on an
average, exceed from fivepence to sevenpence halfpenny per cwt. The
other useful mineral or saline productions of the Burman empire are
coal, saltpetre, soda, and culinary salt. One of the lakes affording
the latter, which is within six or seven miles of the capital, was

extend, as may be seen in orchards growing on the sides of hills,
and in all open forests; and inquires what influence can the earth
have upon the branches on the upper side of a tree, which causes
them to form a different angle with the body of the tree from the
angle formed by the branches on the lower side, so that all the
branches hold a parallel direction to the earth’s surface.—<em class="italic">Silliman’s

11. <em class="italic">Effects of Light on Vegetation</em>.</h5>—The following observations
by Professor Eaton are dated Rensselaer school, Troy, April 30,
1827. “Clouds and rain have obscured the hemisphere during the
last six days. In that time the leaves of all the forests which are
seen from this place have greatly expanded. But they were all of
a pallid hue until this afternoon. Within the period of about six
hours, they have all changed their colour to a beautiful green. As
the only efficient change which has taken place, is that we have a
<span class="xxpn" id="p491">[p491]</span>
serene sky, and a bright sun, we may say with confidence that
this change of colour is produced by the action of the sun’s rays.”</div>

<p>“Seven years ago, next month, I had a still more favourable opportunity
to observe this phenomenon in company with the Hon.
J. Lansing, late Chancellor of this State. While we were engaged
in taking a geological survey of his manor of Blenheim, the leaves
of the forest had expanded to almost the common size in cloudy
weather. I believe the sun had scarcely shone upon them in
twenty days. Standing upon a hill, we observed that the dense forests
upon the opposite side of the Schoharie were almost white. The
sun now began to shine in full brightness. The colour of the forest
absolutely changed so fast that we could perceive its progress. By
the middle of the afternoon, the whole of these extensive forests,
many miles in length, presented their usual summer dress.”—<em class="italic">Silliman’s

<div class="h5d"><h5>
12. <em class="italic">Organization and Reproduction of the Trufle</em>.</h5>—The trufle,
according to the account given of it by M. Turpin, in a memoir
read to the Academy of Sciences, is a vegetable entirely destitute
of leafy appendages or of roots; it is nothing more than a rounded
subterraneous mass, absorbing nourishment upon every point of
its surface, and the reproduction of which is dependent upon bodies
generated within its substance. The trufle is composed of, i. globular
vesicles, destined, to the reproduction of the vegetable; ii.
short and barren filaments, called by M. Turpin, <em class="italic">tigellules</em>. The
whole forms a substance, at first white, but which becomes brown
by age, with the exception of particular white veins. This change
of colour is dependent upon the presence of the reproductive bodies
or <em class="italic">trufinelles</em>. Each globular vesicle is fitted to give birth, on its
internal surface, to a multitude of these reproductive bodies, but
there are only a few of them which perfect the young vegetable.
These dilate considerably, and produce internally other smaller
vesicles, of which, two, three, or four increase in size, become
brown, are beset with small points on their exterior surface, and
fill the interior of the larger vesicle. The small masses thus formed,
are the <em class="italic">trufinelles</em>, and become trufles after the death of their parent.
Thus the brown parts of the trufle are those which contain the trufinelles,
and the interposed white veins are the parts which are destitute
of trufinelles. The parent trufle, having accomplished its
growth and the formation of the reproductive bodies within, gradually
dissolves and supplies that aliment to the young vegetable
which is proper for them; the cavity originally occupied by it in the
earth is then left occupied by a multitude of young trufles, of
which the stronger starve or destroy the others, whilst they frequently
adhere together, and, enlarging in size, reproduce the phenomena
already described.</div>

<p>The reporters of this memoir to the Academy state that they
have verified M. Turpin’s account, but point out a circumstance in
the natural history of the trufle, which is still unexplained. If the
<span class="xxpn" id="p492">[p492]</span>
method described be the only mode in which the trufle is reproduced,
then it is difficult to comprehend the enormous multiplication of
that vegetable in certain parts of France, where immense quantities
are annually collected without exhausting or even diminishing the
race. If the plant has no means of progression, how can the
young trufles leave the place of their birth, and become disseminated
over the soil? The Mémoire received the approbation of the
Academy.—<em class="italic">Revue Ency.</em> xxxv. 794.</p>

13. <em class="italic">Alteration of Corn in a subterraneous Repository</em>.</h5>—An
inhabitant of Deneuvre in the department of Merthe, whilst excavating
in the locality of the ancient citadel of that town, found a
large quantity of corn which appeared to have been carbonized.
A portion was sent to M. Braconnot for examination, but without
any particulars of the cavity containing it. The grain was smooth
on the exterior, and unchanged in form, but its aspect announced
the entire destruction of its proximate principles. It floated on
water, could be crushed between the finger to a black powder, and
when rubbed on paper left traces resembling those of black chalk.</div>

<p>Being analysed, it was found to consist principally of a substance
resembling ulmine in its properties, ulmate of lime and carbonaceous
matter: the proportions were</p>

<p>Although the time during which this corn has been stored up is
probably very long, still M. Braconnot thinks the principal cause of
the change in it has been humidity; and thinks also that the same
may have been the case with the corn lately found in an Egyptian
tomb<a id="fnanchor_135_99" href="#fn_135_99" class="fnanchor">135</a>, and quotes the known fact of corn having been found at
Scarpone, an ancient Roman station, preserved in good condition,
during eighteen centuries, in a reservoir constructed of Roman
mortar.</p>

<p>The best use that could be made of the carbonized corn of
Deneuvre was to apply it as a manure, for it contained the best elements
of a substance of this kind, and M. Braconnot had long since
observed the presence of ulmine in good manure, its acid properties,
and its effects on vegetation. He adds also that Bruyères earth
of excellent quality gave one-fourth of a combustible matter formed
of ulmine and a carbonaceous body but little soluble in potash, the
remaining three-fourths being a pure siliceous sand without a trace
of lime. Yet so effectual is this earth, that, where it cannot be
obtained, certain exotics cannot be cultivated.—<em class="italic">Annales de Chimie</em>,

Ava of a man covered from head to foot with hair, whose history
is not less remarkable than that of the celebrated porcupine man
who excited so much curiosity in England and other parts of
Europe near a century ago. The hair on the face of this singular
being, the ears included, is shaggy, and about eight inches long.
On the breast and shoulders it is from four to five. It is singular
that the teeth of this individual are defective in number, the molares
or grinders being entirely wanting. This person is a native
of the Shan country, or Lao, and from the banks of the upper
portion of the Saluen, or Martaban river; he was presented to the
king of Ava as a curiosity, by the prince of that country. At Ava
he married a Burmese woman, by whom he has two daughters;
the eldest resembles her mother, the youngest is covered with hair
like her father, only that it is white or fair, whereas his is now
brown or black, having, however, been fair when a child, like that
of the infant. With the exceptions mentioned, both the father and
his child are perfectly well-formed, and, indeed, for the Burman
race, rather handsome. The whole family were sent by the king

following are the results obtained by M. Bailly, who has been

<p><em class="italic">Salts of Morphia</em>, applied in this manner, speedily exhibit their
<span class="xxpn" id="p494">[p494]</span>
action upon the brain and nervous system, by the contraction
of the pupils, and often by dysuria and ischuria; nausea and vomiting
are rare; sometimes a sensation of itching is felt in the nasal
cavities, and papular eruptions not unfrequently appear upon the skin.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Extract of Belladonna</em>, applied upon the upper surface of the feet,
produced all the consequences derived from its internal exhibition;
such as dilatation of the pupil and impaired vision.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Extract of Squill</em>, while it augments transpiration, promotes the
urinary secretion, and facilitates expectoration.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Well powdered Strychnine</em> supports the suppuration of wounds
tolerably well, and stimulates the locomotive system without inconveniently
exciting the brain. It happens also in certain palsies, such
as those which are caused by the carbonate of lead, that the power
of motion is restored without the production of those violent
shocks which have been so unpleasant to patients. M. Bailly has observed,
with respect to this medicine in general, that it often excites
a marked turgescence about the head, heightening the colour of
the face, which demands the suspension of the remedy, if not the
intervention of blood-letting.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Perchloride of Mercury</em> (corrosive sublimate) produces an intense
sensation of heat, and corrodes the parts with which it comes in
contact. Sometimes, however, it has been known to relieve the
pains of exostoses, &#38;c. <em class="italic">The proto-chloride</em> (calomel) also excites
pain, particularly if rubbed upon a recently blistered surface. In
this way it may cure old syphilitic affections; but as a set-off
against these advantages, there is sometimes a difficulty in keeping
up the action, as the absorbent powers of the surface wear out by
long continued contact.</p>

<p>One great advantage of the <em class="italic">endermic</em> practice is the exemption of
the digestive organs from an inconvenient or unaccustomed stimulus;
and its importance must be apparent where the stomach is
incapable of retaining medicines, or the power of deglutition is

<p>“The Biscacho<a id="fnanchor_136_100" href="#fn_136_100" class="fnanchor">136</a> is found all over the plains of the Pampas;
like rabbits they live in holes, which are in groups in every
<span class="xxpn" id="p495">[p495]</span>
direction, and which make galloping over these plains very dangerous.
These animals are never seen in the day, but as soon as the lower
limb of the sun reaches the horizon, they are seen issuing from
their holes in all directions, which are scattered in groups like little
villages, all over the Pampas. The biscachos, when full grown,
are nearly as large as badgers, but their head resembles a rabbit,
excepting that they have large bushy whiskers. In the evening
they sit outside their holes, and they all appear to be moralising.
They are the most serious looking animals I ever saw; and even
the young ones are grey headed, have mustachios, and look
thoughtful and grave. <em class="italic">In the day time their holes are always
guarded by two little owls, who are never an instant away from
their post. As one gallops by these owls, they always stand looking
at the stranger and then at each other, moving their old-fashioned
heads in a manner which is quite ridiculous, until one rushes by
them, when fear gets the better of their dignified looks, and they
both run into the biscachos’ “hole</em>.”—(Head’s Rough Notes, p. 82.)</p>

<p>Captain Head has not given us the name of this owl, but in all
probability it was the Strix Cunicularia, or Coquimbo Owl, which is
described as flying <em class="italic">in pairs</em>, sometimes by day, and making its
nest <em class="italic">in long subterraneous burrows</em><a id="fnanchor_137_101" href="#fn_137_101" class="fnanchor">137</a>. In the singular motion of
its head, it however corresponds with the Strix Brasiliana, or
Brownish Horned Owl, mentioned by Maregrave in his History of
Brazil, which he says is easily tamed, and can so <em class="italic">turn about its
neck</em> that the tip of the beak shall exactly point at the middle of
the back; that it also plays with men like an ape, <em class="italic">making many
mowes</em>, (as Willoughby translates it,) <em class="italic">and antic mimical faces</em>,
and snapping with its bill. But for the best account we have
met with, we are indebted to the splendid continuation of Wilson’s
American Ornithology by Lucien Bonaparte, under the title “Burrowing
Owl—a bird,” he says, “that so far from seeking refuge
in the ruined habitations of man, fixes his residence within the
earth; instead of concealing itself in solitary recesses of the forests,
delights to dwell on open plains, in company with animals remarkable
for their social disposition, neatness, and order. Instead of sailing
heavily forth in the obscurity of the evening or morning twilight,
and then retreating to its secluded abode, this bird enjoys the
broadest glare of the noon-day sun, and flying rapidly along,
searches for food or pleasure during the cheerful light of the day.
In the trans-Mississippian territories of the United States, this
very singular bird <em class="italic">resides exclusively in the villages of the Marmot,
or Prairie Dog</em>, whose excavations are so commodious, as to render
it unnecessary that it should dig for itself, as it is said to do in
other parts of the world, where no burrowing animals exist.
These villages are very numerous, and variable in their extent, sometimes
covering only a few acres, and at others spreading over the surface
of the country for miles together. They are composed of slightly
<span class="xxpn" id="p496">[p496]</span>
elevated mounds, about two feet in width at the base, and seldom
exceeding eighteen inches in height. In all these Prairie dog villages,
the burrowing owl is seen moving briskly about, or else in
small flocks scattered among the mounds, and at a distance it may
be mistaken for the marmot itself when sitting erect. They manifest
<em class="italic">but little timidity, and allow themselves to be approached sufficiently
close for shooting</em>; but if alarmed, some or all of them soar
away, and settle down again at a short distance: if further disturbed,
their flight is continued until they are no longer in view,
<em class="italic">or they descend into their dwellings, whence they are difficult to
dislodge</em>. The burrows into which these owls have been seen to
descend on the plains of the river Platte, where they are the most
numerous, were evidently excavated by the marmot, whence it has
been interred by the learned and indefatigable Say<a id="fnanchor_138_102" href="#fn_138_102" class="fnanchor">138</a>, that they
were either common, though unfriendly residents of the same habitation,
or that the owl was the sole occupant by right of conquest.”
We have in the statements of Captain Head, however, a
proof that both tenants habitually resort at the same time to one
burrow; and we are assured by Pike and others, that a common
danger often drives them into the same excavation where lizards
and rattlesnakes also enter for concealment and safety.</p>

<p>In the above extracts we have noted in italics the striking similarity
to the account given by Captain Head.</p>

is described as principally found in North America.</p>

Fish</em>.</h5>—We have received the following from Mr. Arnold of
Guernsey.</div>

<p class="signature">16th <em class="italic">August</em>, 1827.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Having understood that the correctness of Dr. Mac Culloch’s
statements respecting my pond, and the attempts to propagate sea
fish in it, have been questioned, I beg to say that his statements
are perfectly correct; and to add further, that during nearly four
months of the year the water is perfectly fresh, and is drunk by
cattle.</p>

<p>In summer, the saltness varies; but no examination yet made
has discovered in it more than half as much salt as is contained in
the neighbouring sea-water.</p>

<p>I further beg leave to add, that the general size of the pond in
summer is about four acres and a half; in winter, when swelled by
the rains, it is extended to upwards of fifteen acres; which will
account for the freshness of the water.</p>

20. <em class="italic">Mode of keeping Apples</em>.</h5>—It seems not to be generally
known, that apples may be kept the whole year round by being
<span class="xxpn" id="p497">[p497]</span>
immersed in corn, which receives no injury from their contact.
If the American apples were packed among grain, they would
arrive here in much finer condition. In Portugal it is customary
to have a small ledge in every apartment, (immediately under the
cornice,) barely wide enough to hold an apple: in this way the
ceilings are fringed with fruit, which are not easily got at without a
ladder; while one glance of the eye serves to shew if any depredations
have been committed.</div>

<div class="h5d"><h5>
21. <em class="italic">On the Cultivation and Forcing Sea Kale</em>.</h5>—The Crambe
maritima, or Sea Kale, is an indigenous plant of this and other
countries of Europe, and found on the sandy beach of the sea-shore.</div>

<p>It has been long introduced into our gardens as a culinary
vegetable, but it is only within the last thirty years, that it has
been brought into general use, and subjected to a mode of cultivation,
very different from that which was first bestowed upon it.</p>

<p>The principal value of this plant is its property of early growth;
appearing at table at a time when few such things can be had. It
precedes asparagus, for which it is no bad substitute; and as it
makes a dish of itself, it gives a variety to the delicacies of the
table; and if the opinions given of its medicinal virtues be correct,
it is well worth cultivation, and the notice we are about to take of
it, in describing an easy method of having it in great perfection
throughout the winter months, and up to the time it may be
gathered from the natural ground.</p>

<p>Prepare one or more beds (with alleys two feet wide between)
for the reception of the seeds, in the following manner: mark out
the bed or beds two and a half feet wide, and of any required
length, as near as can be from east to west; line off the sides and
ends, driving a stake at each corner to ascertain the boundaries;
dig out the earth of the bed one spade deep, removing it to some
distance; fill this excavation with the purest and finest sand which
can be procured in the neighbourhood, either from the sea-shore,
the bed of a river, or from a pit. It signifies nothing of what
colour it is, so it be pure, and as free from loam as it can be had;
for in proportion as the soil of the bed is poor or rich, so will the
flavour of the plant be when dressed. When this precaution is not
taken, and when the plants are suffered to enjoy the rich and cultivated
soil of a kitchen garden, or the situation made so, by rich
dressings or coverings of fresh manure, the plants are stimulated
into an unnatural luxuriance, which deteriorates the flavour, imparting
to them that strong disagreeable scent and taste, resembling
common cabbage, than which nothing can be a greater drawback on
the value of the vegetable; but when grown entirely in pure sand,
the flavour is mild and pleasant, and is relished by most palates.</p>

<p>When the bed is filled with sand and raised therewith about
six inches above the natural level of the ground, (and this should
be done previous to the end of March, which is the sowing season,)
draw a drill along the middle, from end to end, about three inches
<span class="xxpn" id="p498">[p498]</span>
deep, in which drop the seeds pretty thickly, as they can be thinned
out to the proper distance after they come up. If the sand or
weather be dry at the time of sowing, give a little water in the drill
and immediately cover up. If the seed be good, the plants will
soon appear, and when they are advanced to a size large enough
to enable the gardener to choose the most promising, let them
be thinned out to the distance of six or seven inches, the distance
at which they may remain. During the summer, the bed should
be occasionally watered with <em class="italic">dung water</em>; and this for the purpose
of encouraging the growth of the plants on their first setting off;
and as manure given in this shape is more fugitive than when
applied in a more solid or concentrated state, it cannot impart
rankness to the plants when they arrive at that age fit to be brought
to table.</p>

<p>The plants cannot be forced, nor should any of their shoots be
cut, the first winter after sowing; but should be suffered and
assisted to establish themselves, and gain sufficient strength to
yield adequate crops, in the succeeding years.</p>

<p>About the month of November in the second winter after sowing,
a part at one end of the bed should be prepared for forcing. For
this purpose, and in order that it may be done with facility and
effect, a rough wooden frame or frames should be made, eighteen
inches high behind, and one foot high in front, shaped like a common
hot-bed frame, and of any convenient and portable length;
and in width, the same as the bed. Light wooden covers in convenient
lengths should be fixed by hinges to the back; these
may be raised at will for admission of light and air, and, in fine
weather, may be thrown entirely back. When the frames are
placed, dig out the alleys one foot deep to receive linings of hot
dung, which may be banked op against both the back and front of
the frame. The surface of the bed within the frame must be
covered with soft, short straw, or hay, nine inches thick, to arrest
the heat which rises from the linings, and form that warm humid
region into which the shoots will advance. The temperature of
these dark frames must be regulated by due attendance; and in
intensely cold or frosty weather, the frames at night will require
coverings of mats and litter, to prevent the plants receiving a
check.</p>

<p>The required supply of the family—the time for it—and the
length or number of the frames, must be judged of by the gardener,
and who will act accordingly; but two frames are indispensable;
because the second should be considerably advanced by
the time the crop in the first is all cut.</p>

<p>Young plants may be transplanted; and if they are to be had,
may be tried; but the safer way is to sow and plant both, to prevent
disappointment; and in order that the roots be not too much
exhausted by forcing, one bed should be forced in one year, and
another the next.</p>

<p>The crowns of the roots have a tendency to rise; and as annual
<span class="xxpn" id="p499">[p499]</span>
additions of sand will be required after the autumnal dressing, the
beds by these additions become unsightly; but cutting off the
most aspiring (with its flowering stem) every summer, will keep the
whole within proper bounds. Instead of covering with dung or
litter, to protect from winter’s frost, the frames may be set on those
parts intended to be forced, to answer that purpose; and the
uncovered parts of the beds may receive a coat of mould out of
the alleys, to be drawn back off the sand in the spring.</p>

<p>The writer of this began to force Sea Kale as long ago as 1798,
using hot dung within, as well as without, a frame with glazed
lights; but soon found that, neither the glass nor dung <em class="italic">inside</em>
was necessary or suitable; he, therefore, afterwards succeeded,
by the above plan, to produce the finest crops of this vegetable, at
any time in the winter months; and can confidently recommend
such management, especially to those who have no hot-house or
hot-bed frames; because when there is any early forced house or
frames, if old roots are properly selected and potted in the
autumn, and placed in such house or frame, where there is sufficient
heat, and well shut up from light by whelming other empty
pots over them, a crop may be had in this way, without the trouble
and expense of out-door forcing.</p>

<p>The original Journal of July–December, 1827 was evidently printed in
two parts, at different times. The title page of the first part (page
1) was printed with a footer "<span class="allcaps">JULY–OCT.</span> 1827". The title page of the
second part (page <a href="#p237">237</a>) contained a similar footer
"<span class="allcaps">OCT.–DEC.</span> 1827".
The text of these footers have been moved into the titles on the same
pages.</p>

<p>The Table of Contents for the first part was labeled "<em
class="italic">Jul.–Oct.</em> 1827" The Table of Contents for
the second part was not similarly labeled, but the transcriber
has inserted a label "<em class="italic">Oct.–Dec.</em> 1827".
The section titled "Proceedings of
the Horticultural Society" that starts on page <a href="#p190">190</a> originally had no
entry in the Table of Contents; such an entry has been inserted. The
original Table of Contents for Part One did not include a reference
to the Meteorological Diary for Jun–Aug; such a reference has been
inserted. The two Meteorological Diaries were originally printed as
three-month tables, approximately 7.4 inches wide by 3.9 inches,
turned 90°, using 6.5 point type. These tables have been divided into
three tables each, one for each month.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p031">31</a>: In the phrase "ratio of which to the breadth has been
augmented by them from about
<span class="mixfract">3<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span></span>.1,
to 4.1", the phrase
"<span class="mixfract">3<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span></span>.1"
apparently denotes a ratio of 3.25:1, and "4.1" must mean a ratio 4:1.</p>

<p>Pages <a href="#p136">136</a> and <a href="#p137">137</a>:
The characters, such as <span class="nowrap">M′,</span> <span
class="nowrap">S′,</span> <span class="nowrap">M,</span> <span
class="nowrap">S,</span> etc. denoting mathematical variables were
originally printed in italics. This use of italic has been discarded on
these pages.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p194">194</a>: In the text following 'M. Hachette says, “The air', there was

"sin.&#8201;[(<em class="italic">n</em>−1)&#8201;30° + 124°&#8201;8′)]". The last right parenthesis is not
balanced, and has been removed.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p425">425</a>: "council,) the chair" was changed to "council, (the chair".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p451">451</a>: The large table (originally 7.0 inches wide by 3.8 inches,
turned 90°, printed in 9 point type) was divided into two parts,
retaining the first column in both parts. The table on page 452 was
restructured to three columns instead of six.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p455">455</a>: For the quotation begun 'Bailey of Boston,

following paragraph.</p>
